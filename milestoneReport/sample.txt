Through one war with Mexico and relentless wars with Indian tribes, we became a country that spanned a continent. The Spanish-American War and the First World War marked our arrival on the world stage. And the Second World War left us as one of the two preeminent powers on the planet.

A July 2011 article in The Economist observed this sad reality of human nature: "Both (the USDA and IOM) agree that merely improving access to healthy food does not change consumer behavior. Open a full-service supermarket in a food desert and shoppers tend to buy the same artery-clogging junk food as before — they just pay less for it.

Brazil's central bank has been cutting rates aggressively; it reduced its benchmark rate to 9% on April 18, down from 11% at the beginning of the year.

Advocates of barefoot training swear by it, claiming that ditching their shoes has improved the running experience and solved injury problems. Four months ago, 29-year-old Salt Lake City runner Brett Williams was on the verge of buying the Nike Airmax 360, a $160 shoe. In researching the shoe, he stumbled across www.runningbarefoot.org, which has become the Web-based bible for barefoot runners. "I decided I'd had enough and went barefoot," says Mr. Williams, who on Saturday ran the Salt Lake City marathon, his first marathon, while barefoot. Mr. Williams says he enjoys running more now, and suffered only a minor scrape during the race that was less painful than the blisters that often develop on the feet of shod runners. "Your connection with the ground beneath your feet is absolutely lost with shoes on," says Mr. Williams. "I am utterly convinced your feet don't need support or cushioning. If they do it's because you're not running correctly."

"CJ is kind of a thermometer instead of a thermostat," Donatelli said. "He's an up-and-down guy. What he knows, and the rest of the guys in the program know, is that you're going to earn everything you get, and there isn't a coach in this building who cares who is out on that field as long as it's going to be the best guy.

* Avicii, who had Madonna join him for his Ultra set, lit up the night like no other.

What's even better is that Robinson, who graduated from Morehouse College in Atlanta in June, has already made good on a promise to help make college accessible for a Cleveland kid like him.

But in 1976, the lives of Mitt Romney and Benjamin Netanyahu intersected, briefly but indelibly, in the 16th-floor offices of the Boston Consulting Group, where both had been recruited as corporate advisers. At the most formative time of their careers, they sized each other up during the firm's weekly brainstorming sessions, absorbing the same analytical view of the world.
I still believe the Rams aren't going anywhere. But I also believe that Kroenke isn't going to roll over like a puppy getting his belly rubbed. This is going to be a tough, grind-it-out negotiation that is going to be resolved (I think, I hope, I pray) with a lot of very smart people in a room from both the Rams organization and local officials coming to an agreement that meets the needs of everyone and keeps the National Football League in our town like it ought to be.
At Hawkins, teachers have been placed six to a room. They requested coffee pots and refrigerators.

According to McCollum's office, it is legal for businesses such as TFR to collect upfront fees as long as they don't lead consumers to believe they are affiliated with the attorney general's office.
It's becoming apparent that what Councilmember Vreeland has in common with Punxsutawney Phil is that both are in hibernation. Last week's council meeting was unable to conduct any business due to the fact that they lacked a quorum. On the agenda was an appeal for an Assisted Living Center project that, frankly, this city needs to go forward on because of the need for economic development. The paid consultants all showed up, but due to the fact that council was one short of a quorum, the hearing on this matter was cancelled. When one considers that Jim has also tabled a General Plan recommendation so that he can push campgrounds on a 5-acre parcel on Pedro Point, as opposed to allowing a residential development with the resulting property tax revenue, one starts to get the impression that he's trying to sink our ship. If he succeeds, he can probably just go back to sleep.

Congratulations to Britain's Queen Elizabeth for reigning over the U.K. for 60 years. Throughout my 74 years, I've heard many Americans state they think we sometimes wish we had a Royal Family of our own. Indeed, the pageantry and ceremony connected with the British Royals is, for many of us, a joy to witness.

Small banks and credit unions had mixed reactions. They had argued that the exemption for banks under $10 billion wouldn't help if the cap was as low as originally proposed.

In 1973's "The Watergate Cookbook," recipe titles indicate a period-appropriate cynicism -- there's "McCord's Clouded Consommé (which sounds delicious, with tomatoes, sherry, chives and cream), "Ehrlichman's Cover Up Casserole and Mitchell's Sitting Duck. It's a refreshing read, compared with so many surviving Junior League-esque spiral-bound books -- decades of earnest collections of senators' wives recipes for hot crab dip, easy chicken cacciatore and stuffed peppers.

I was impressed by the variety of tastes and the execution  curry beef puffs (stuffed pastries), steamed pig's feet, stuffed eggplant, shrimp dumplings and even a little bean-curd puff with a sweetened filling that suggests you might want to have it as a dessert. Turnip cake in XO sauce ramped up a dim sum regular  squares of mashed and fried turnip  with a flavorful sauce enhanced by bits of ham, dried shrimp, soy, pepper and lettuce.

Why it might work: Red means "ready" in primate language. Some monkeys and apes advertise their sexual prime times on their skin, turning bright red throughout their vulvas, buttocks, chests and faces during ovulation. Male primates prefer to mate with these flushed females. We humans may not have red rumps, but men may be drawn to the color -- whether gleaming from lips, splashed across camisoles or in the blush on a face -- all the same, Elliot says.
Part of the move to capped data is to get consumers accustomed to the idea that data isn't a limitless resource. If carriers didn't move to usage-based data plans while rolling out newer speedy data networks, the networks would get abused, Zachary Investment Research analyst Patrick Comack said. And while the pricing of Verizon's network is higher than AT&T's, its service is speedier, so it can charge a premium for now.

These guys being spies, it doesn't take long, thanks to illegal surveillance on both their parts, for them to figure out that they are dating the same woman. They agree to a competition. They will both court Lauren, and she -- not knowing about the contest -- will choose the man most right for her.

The Architecture of Harry Weese, by Robert Bruegmann (W.W. Norton; 240 pages; $59.95). Anyone who has ever been entranced by the vaulted concrete catacombs of the Washington, D.C., Metro system knows the work of Harry Weese.

Two years ago I was working in south Texas and got the opportunity to see Pete Kozma play when Springfield came into Corpus Christi to play the Hooks. From what I saw he was out of his league then. D. Descalso was clearly a player w/ more going for him then....a better hitter, fielder, and w/ more awareness of what was going on from play to play on the field. I've been removed from the baseball scene since then (and also out of the country). What is your current take on Kozma? What I remember is a player w/ little chance

The correct thing to do would have been for him to paddle behind where I had to go. This would have caused him to have to eat the whitewater, but would have given me a clear shot at making the lined up wave.

However, don't weigh down your salad with a creamy dressing. Choose a salad dressing that is low in fat and keep it on the side, adding it only as needed.

That's the measure of a top-10 program. Because Oregon, which played in the Rose Bowl after the 1994 season, and a Fiesta Bowl in 2001, has reached the national stage before. Then, dropped off.

Answer - The name of the problem is "urinary incontinence," the involuntary loss of urine. Two kinds of incontinence exist. One is stress incontinence. This is urine loss when physically active, like lifting a heavy bag of groceries, moving furniture or any such work requiring straining. It also happens on laughing, coughing or sneezing. In all these instances, pressure within the abdomen forces the urinary bladder to expel urine. I don't think this is your kind of incontinence.

The revelation that News of the World editors were allegedly involved in hacking the voicemail of a 13-year-old murder victim, among other such suspected transgressions, as well as the subsequent shuttering of the tabloid, has represented a veritable feast for Murdoch's competitors, who have approached the matter as a scandal that goes to fundamental issues concerning the globalized Murdoch media empire.

A Wall Street Journal spokeswoman declined to comment on the paper's coverage of the matter, which also included a story Friday about how the scandal was a test for James Murdoch, Rupert's son and heir apparent.

As in the case of health insurance, a one-size-fits-all approach makes little sense. The cost of unemployment varies widely in terms of the time it takes to find another job. Currently, the average duration of unemployment is 40.9 weeks, almost three times what it was prior to the Great Recession. Paying the same standard six months of unemployment benefits in a poor labor market as a good one is as desirable as a health insurance policy that pays for the same number of days in a hospital for a heart transplant as it does for appendicitis.

Next up is the Morgan Library & Museum at Madison Avenue and 36th Street, built as the private domain of financier Pierpont Morgan in 1906, later recast as a nonlending public institution. Now we commoners can gawk at the myriad cultural prizes Morgan amassed between 1890 and 1913, including medieval manuscripts, letters by Charles Dickens and Mark Twain, handwritten scores by Mozart and Beethoven and three Gutenberg Bibles. The walnut bookshelves rise three stories. The fireplace is big enough to burn three Christmas trees at once (although we discourage this because it can be dangerous).

Credit for the boulevard's promising start goes to the design concept, which is a collaboration between Jacobs Macdonald: Cityworks and city staff led by the Department of Public Works. If anything, you wish the planners had won a few more battles. The "local" lanes should have bumpy paving to give drivers a tactile cue to slow down, for instance. But the convenience of having asphalt over the boulevard's buried service lines won out with engineers.
The movements by Gingrich and Paul have largely been a sideshow for the Romney campaign, which is now engaged in rapid build-out of its organization at its Boston headquarters and in key primary states.

The first tiebreaker in the draft for teams with identical records is strength of schedule. Because the Bears played a stronger schedule than the Cardinals, Cowboys, Eagles, Jets, Raiders (their pick now belongs to the Bengals) and Chargers, they pick last among all the 8-8 teams. And picking 19th as opposed to 13th definitely could cost the Bears dearly. If you say the Bears' biggest need is an edge rusher, the Cardinals, Cowboys, Jets and Chargers all could use one as well (though each of those teams runs a 3-4). If you say the Bears really need an offensive tackle, the Cardinals, Jets and Chargers are threats to take one of them. And if you still want another receiver, the Cardinals, Jets and Bengals all could ruin the Bears' plans. As for DeCastro, I think 19 is too high to take a guard who is not elite. If you are going to reach, don't do it for a guard. Do it for a player who can impact your team with big plays. I really don't see guard as a need for this team.

So what does that have to do with beer? Almost nothing, except that when I noticed the date, it got me thinking about more recent Italian history. When you think of Italian beer, usually just two names come to mind: Moretti and Peroni, the two largest Italian breweries. Both brands have been available in the United States for years, and neither makes particularly exciting beers. There are a few other large breweries, but they all brew similar-tasting pale lagers.

The Labor Department said that employers added the fewest jobs in nine months and the unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent in June.

Though it certainly hasn't neutralized the lust for money, now that Hollywood's executive suites are occupied by Ivy Leaguers and MBAs who report to giant international-minded media conglomerates, the lust for respectability has only intensified. One can see that attitude on display every Oscar time when the industry rewards what it regards as its best, which is why British films typically fare so well. The Brits, by Hollywood logic, are a class act, and handing them Oscars is proof that Hollywood itself has taste. It may make a lot of junk, but it doesn't mistake that junk for art. Junk, not even high-grossing junk, doesn't win Oscars. High-minded movies do.

The best of the main courses is the whole fish that's either grilled or roasted in the wood oven. The petrale sole ($42) is about 1 1/4 pounds and is rubbed with salt and pepper and then put in the hot oven so the outside forms a crust, sealing in the moisture. The waiter then brings out the whole fish before taking it away to remove the bones, if requested.

Is this too harsh? Regrettably, no. What gives me hope is that so many of the younger members of the Senate in both parties are giving voice to the frustration they feel with what the Senate has become. If their ranks are reinforced by this November's election, and if they start talking to each other and realize how widely shared their feelings of dissatisfaction are, perhaps the change could bubble up from within.

Even the dozen original songs on the group's latest album, "Paradise Hop," sound like they could've been written by coal miners or hobos in the 1920s. Never mind their modern references to collapsing interstate bridges and the like. Even their wild version of "I Am the Walrus" from 2010's "Minnesota Beatle Project, Vol. 2" album -- which became a calling card of sorts locally -- sounded like an old-timey barn-dance number.

Despite the jaw-dropping price tags on these supermansions, many developers aren't asking nearly what they would have during the market's peak. In Palm Beach, Fla., builder Dan Swanson currently has an $84 million home adjacent to a large nature preserve that's been on the market since May. The project began three years ago, when he tore down two homes on a cul-de-sac and built a 27,000-square-foot house that has parking for more than 50 cars, a 60-foot swimming pool and six juice bars spread across the main and guest quarters. The asking price, he says, could have been more than $100 million several years ago.

The payments are compensation for GM's earnings last year, a speedy turnaround that surprised many in the auto industry. The company emerged from bankruptcy cleansed of most of its debt and burdensome contracts. Concessions made by the United Auto Workers union helped the company to make money even at historically low sales volumes.

The 92.3% figure has been criticized by a number of independent fact checkers, including Politifact – which rated the claim “mostly false.” Politifact noted that the Romney campaign calculated the figure by using employment data spanning four years, including Obama’s first month in office in January of 2009, when the economy was still losing jobs that began to disappear under former President George W. Bush. Job losses were higher for women during that period because many men had already lost their jobs and many women followed.
Essentially, families who qualify for food stamps (now known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) automatically get free lunches. As a former education reporter, I remember that often enrollment in the free lunch program often drops off in the higher grades.

The first hotel so designated in May was Le Bristol, a Second Empire edifice on the fashionable Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré. I toured it too because Le Bristol just finished a renovation, expanding into another wing and creating new quarters overlooking a French garden for its Michelin three-star restaurant. Le Bristol, opened in 1925, preserves the dignified grand hotel tradition; it has been owned by the same family since 1978. Its guest rooms are large, quiet and lush; old master paintings and tapestries; a small army of uniformed doormen; more floral arrangements than a funeral; and a house kitten.

As Vinas began to meet higher-ranking members of al-Qaida under the command of Saleh al-Somali, the network's former chief of external operations, he caught their attention by suggesting that the Long Island Railroad — a commuter rail system he knew by heart — would make a ripe target for an attack, using a suitcase full of explosives left on a train. He also pitched the idea of blowing up a Walmart by buying a television, rigging it with a bomb and returning it to the store.
Also nifty is an all-new flip-and-fold feature for the rear seats that's standard on all CR-Vs. When cargo trumps rear passengers, owners can pull a lever in the cargo area or a strap by the rear seat cushion. In a quick motion with all the choreography of a Russian ballet but none of the blisters, the rear seat cushion flips up, the headrests flip down, and the seat back folds to the floor. The result is an almost flat cargo area that swallows just under 71 cubic feet of gear, a small decrease from the previous CR-V.

Ferry and Gilbert will agree on one thing: They did not like how the Cavs executed at the end of the season. Much of that could be attributed to injuries.

White is so intent on making the restaurant accessible that he has gone out of his way to make the service casual. Wine is opened and tasted at the counter, then placed on the table. The staffers wear whatever they want, so it's hard to tell if the person walking by is a waiter or a customer. Yet the crew is not only friendly and accommodating, but it's diligent about changing out plates, bringing utensils and checking back to clear the tables or to see if everything is going as planned. Don't let their casual dress fool you - these people know what they're doing.

Microsoft dropped another proposed feature, known as InPrivate Subscriptions, that would have let users further conceal their online browsing habits, by automatically blocking Web addresses suspected of consumer tracking if those addresses appeared on "black lists" compiled by privacy groups.
Booms become busts because justifiable confidence becomes foolish optimism. So it was. Believing the world less risky, people took more risks. Investment banks and households increased their debt. Lending standards eroded, because borrowers' repayment prospects were thought to have improved. Regulators relaxed oversight, because markets seemed more stable and self-correcting. On the fringes, ethical standards frayed; criminality increased. The rest, as they say, is history.
An animal clone is a genetic copy of a donor animal, similar to identical twins but born at different times. Cloning is not the same as genetic engineering, which involves altering, adding or deleting DNA; cloning does not change the gene sequence.

Starting in a granite-based ponderosa forest, the trail steadily climbs 2,300 feet up to Spruce Mountain, then loops back down to the trailhead. Pines make up the predominant feature, but enough stands of Gambel oak exist to have inspired the town of Groom Creek's original name of Oakdale. A large forest of oaks on the trail's south edge weaves a cozy thicket with crooked, spindly trunks. Along Spruce Ridge, a sprinkling of white fir follows the trail; their frosty blue-green needles practically beam through the green cover.

Danny Granger and George Hill each scored 18 points and Paul George had 17 points and eight rebounds for Indiana. Glen Davis led the Magic with 18 points and 10 rebounds, but he shot five for 16 from the field. J.J. Redick scored 13 points and Jameer Nelson had 12 for Orlando. The Pacers were heavy favorites in the series because Dwight Howard, Orlando's All-Star center, is out because of a back injury. Indiana lost Game 1, 81-77, on Saturday, and the frustrated Pacers fought hard to avoid a two-game deficit. Indiana outrebounded Orlando, 26-13, in the second half and held the Magic to 36% shooting overall. Indiana has held the Magic below 40% shooting in both games.

There's no doubting the passion and talent of "Detention" co-writer and director Joseph Kahn, and you have to give him credit for trying to "throw a hand grenade into cinema," as Kahn puts it on his Twitter feed. Kahn touches on all the hallmarks of the typical teen horror film: the crazy party at the nerd's house, the prom, the idiot cops who ignore all the warning signs even as the body count rises, the BFFs who become arch-enemies, the outcast nerd girl who's virtually invisible as she pines for her cute friend, the blond bitch of a cheerleader, the hallway hijinks, the jerkoff principal. But Kahn spins virtually every cliche into yet another insanely trippy subplot. There's a stuffed bear that's actually a time machine, a strange guy in a hoodie who's been in detention for 20 years, a mother-daughter body-switch that leads to far too many 1990s references and a killer named CinderHella, which is based on the movie-within-a-movie "Cinderhella."
One of my mother's prized possessions was her riding lawn mower. It was a big deal, because she was very particular about the upkeep of her two-acre property in Canton, which had shade trees, flower beds and a living fence to block out views of the neighbors' messy yard.

It's more that it is a catalyst for something bigger -- the human capacity for loyalty, decency, even love. Set in the French port city of the title, it gives us a throwback look at life in a small, lower-class neighborhood, where everyone knows each other and modern life seems to exist somewhere else.
Perhaps it just drove home the point that the Nets are headed toward breaking one of the NBA's legacy records, the 9-73 record of the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers. Having that as the last line on his career resume probably didn't seem to appealing to the proud Harris.

Israel would attack in the name of protecting its security, but at the end of the day, her security lies in peace — a peace derived from a comprehensive and just settlement with the Palestinians. If that is done, including return of most of the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, then the chances of Israel living in peace with all her Islamic neighbors will be greatly improved. And further, such a peace settlement would take the wind out of the sails of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the mullahs in Iran. Their vitriolic tirades against Israel would likely diminish, but even if they continue, they would be unlikely to lead to attacks (nuclear or non-nuclear) on Israel.

We've seen all this before, haven't we? The infrastructural guts of the modern city as a setting for explosions, gunfights and increasingly manic race-the-clock scenarios? How many movie heroes have climbed atop an elevator, as the character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt does? How many more have plotted an ingenious route through a building's air ducts? These places aren't new. They're architectural clichés, dredged up from Hollywood's collective memory bank.

Regulating hydraulic fracturing or "fracking" is not anti-business, it's a sound way to protect health and public safety while enabling responsible use of a valuable natural resource. Last week, theU.S. Environmental Protection Agencyissued rules restricting harmful emissions from such natural gas wells in a classic regulatory win-win. The new rules require drilling companies to capture gases that are often allowed to escape into the atmosphere.

Proposition 8's backers tried to claim that the decision by then-U.S. District Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker was invalid because Walker is gay. That was always a faulty argument — divorced judges rule on divorce law, judges with children decide cases in juvenile court, judges of all races resolve civil rights claims. Now, a three-judge panel of the appellate court has made it clear that the reasons for rejecting California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage were not the result of one judge's personal situation but rather were based solidly on the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which contains the guarantee of equal protection of the law. There must be a rational basis for laws, rather than a desire to single out a particular group. During the trial, lawyers and witnesses for Proposition 8 failed to establish a valid argument in favor of the amendment to the state Constitution that limited marriage to heterosexual couples.

Romney has won more than 55% of the delegates allocated to date and needs about 45% of the remaining delegates to go over the top. Rick Santorum's extremely slim chance of becoming the nominee depends on a contested convention rejecting Romney on the first ballot and then turning to him as an alternative. That scenario, which has never materialized in the modern primary era, has become even more remote as Romney has won pivotal victories in Michigan, Ohio and, most recently, Illinois.

"I think we could potentially get on a slippery slope, where people will be picked on because of how they look as opposed to what they have done, and that is, I think, something that we have to try to avoid at all costs," he said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who also faces a tough reelection, has said he won't bring up a bill unless advocates can find a replacement for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

In fact, preservatives prevent the growth of harmful bacteria on the product as it sits on bathroom counters or gets knocked around in the bottom of a purse.

It's almost embarrassing to answer the question of whether or not a socially conservative woman could appeal to feminists, because the answer is a tautology. The two categories -- social conservative and feminist -- are fundamentally opposed on the basic issues of gender roles and women's rights. The libertarian strain of movement conservatism isn't necessarily opposed to women's rights, but the whole point of social conservatism is to roll back the social gains made by various groups, especially women and gay people. Social conservatives may pretty up their views with language about "life" and "family," but at the end of the day, we're seeing a struggle between feminists and anti-feminists.

But it takes at least twice that amount of nerve, plus no small amount of irony, for the group to put out a press release accusing the other side of being funded by "special interests that will directly benefit from its passage."

If you think you've seen this kind of fear-mongering before, it's because you have. Roll the calendar back 50 years, and it was bigots and opportunists playing these kinds of games in city neighborhoods, trying to stoke fears that integration was going to ruin people's neighborhoods. They'd hire black families to pretend they were living in an area, then watch as white families panicked.

Guys who are that big and that active have a chance to play at that level."

I agree that there needs to be some improvement in the board's responsiveness. I offered two possible suggestions. He criticized one ( the parallel school board) for lack of specificity. Space does not allow that specificity. I would be happy to provide. The second suggestion, which Mr. Nellies chose not to comment on, was to elect two members to the board county-wide. This would add a voice on the board that wouldn't focus on politics. Both of these ideas would help responsiveness. What they wouldn't do is interject the vicissitudes of politics into how to teach children to read.

In this situation, someone has to take charge. For Damon, it was his father, tireless, loving guardian of the family's well-being and fierce watchdog over his brilliant, ailing son. Damon's mother was just as deeply connected to her son and to all their children, but in the ongoing struggle that was Damon's medical condition, Doron was the project manager, guiding an incomparably important effort that was elusive, ever-shifting, and never entirely in his hands. Like a determined and lonely warrior, the author writes of his personal quest, "I scour the earth in search of a cure for Damon."

The first time I ever saw players and coaches from both teams kneel at midfield after a game was at Nebraska, with Brown standing in the middle. Some participated, some shuffled past the group on the way to the locker room. I remember wondering at the time if somebody of a different or no faith would take issue. If that has happened, I've never heard, and group prayer occurs on football fields at all levels. No matter your spiritual preference, there is something uplifting about seeing guys who just knocked the stuffing out of one another for the previous three hours, kneel together in a moment of reflection.

Smaardyk said Gardner is an extreme case, but it isn't the only district having difficulties with finances. “I would not say that it's limited to them entirely,” she said. “I would say they're one of the first we've downgraded.

Because Democrats passed on an opportunity to do right by the taxpayers, they're now being punished by the party in power.

The worst stench of all is the campaign's reliance on the so-called Huron report, which is nothing but a late-coming PowerPoint presentation based on a lot of guesswork about tax credits, possible changes in technology and possible changes in the cost of producing solar energy.

øBring to a Boyle: This series is tight enough that Brian Boyle's health could be an important factor. The 6-7 forward has been out of the lineup the past two games with a concussion, and his status is unknown. He had three goals and 19 hits in his first five games against Ottawa. Brandon Dubinsky didn't skate Friday. Boyle is important to the Rangers' secondary scoring. Joel Ward might be the player to look at for Washington to provide secondary scoring. He has a history of stepping up big in the postseason, shown again with his overtime winner in Game 7 against Boston.

A few FACTS for you posters:
Everything flows from the sly audacity of the premise -- rival champions who join forces to become the first male/male pair in figure-skating history. Mr. Ferrell's Chazz Michael Michaels is as frowzily macho as Mr. Heder's Jimmy MacElroy is ethereally fey. And though the plot twists that unite them are ingenious, the genius of the production, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon, lies in its performers, who play their ludicrous roles with fervent seriousness. (There's no way of knowing who did what with the script, which is credited to five writers: Craig Cox, Jeff Cox, Busy Philipps, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky.)

This in one way is the eternal story of Los Angeles, the city of self-invention. But it is also strange and unique to Chandler. He was too old for this youthful city; he was too different, in his English tweeds and with his fragile wife. He was difficult: When they were working on "Double Indemnity," he complained that Wilder adjusted the blinds in their office without first asking his permission. Chandler's path from failed ex-oilman to great writer is one that is almost impossible to fathom, nonetheless follow.

He actually goes south down Second Avenue, then east onto Monroe, then over to Adams, where he floors the accelerator and bounds up the steps of Symphony Hall. -- The Arizona Republic ________________________________________________________________________

Use disposable: For a casual party, there is no need to bring out the fine china, especially when some paper products look as if they belong in a butler's pantry. Plus, at the end of the party, there is virtually no clean up. "Paper products give you a basis for color coordination," Raymond says. Many discount and party stores offer paper goods in contrasting colors and patterns, so don't be afraid to mix and match. Have plates and utensils on the table, with enough extras in a nearby place. Put extra garbage bags in the bottom of the trash container so that you can attend to overfills easily.

"That's when I got nervous," said Hong, 36, who has insurance through his job at an investment firm.
When Obama says he'll "stabilize" the budget outlook, he really means he's doing nothing to reverse the trend. The so-called $3 trillion in "additional deficit reduction" isn't a reduction at all. It's just a deceitful way of saying that the cumulative deficit over the next 10 years will be $7 trillion instead of $10 trillion in the baseline estimate. In other words, the national debt will increase by $7 trillion.
The obvious problem facing the University of Missouri's Board of Curators and Timothy M. Wolfe, its out-of-the-blue choice as the university's new president, was this: How do you explain the selection of a former software executive with no significant academic credentials as the leader of a four-campus university system?
Because of a closing stretch of games, Seton Hall would eventually find itself on the outside looking in at the NCAA Tournament. But hearing that finality played out on national television — and getting to that point — was the roughest part.
Even if U.S. consumption of oil drops, it will have little if any impact on gasoline prices, since oil is priced globally and increased demand from China and other developing nations continues to push prices up.
Some dispensary owners were allowed to secure a certain amount of pot to use in a new location. That "manifest product" was weighed and measured on Tuesday and must match what goes into the new business, said Vagge.

Plus, again, evidence of a sharp uptick in such shenanigans would suggest that new accountability measures are getting some response: Teachers and principals who can’t get it together to deliver better results are at least moved to cover up, distort and fudge.

Despite its vast oil reserves,Venezuela's troubles are mounting. The country is politically and economically divided. Unemployment is rampant and inflation has hovered near 30%. The country's homicide rate is among the highest in the hemisphere, with near-daily reports of killings and kidnappings. And even the president's most ardent supporters now concede that his "Bolivarian" socialist revolution is losing its appeal as voters tire of his constant campaigning and vitriolic attacks against opponents.
"Through our joint efforts, we've sent a resounding message to the Mexican cartels that Arizona is off limits to their operatives," Matthew Allen, special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in Arizona, said in a prepared statement.

The site won’t look much different. It will have the same pictures and background, but “it will be more user-friendly,” with fewer tabs to hit, said Hain. For example, visitors will be able to find the agenda and minutes for a particular Borough Council meeting together on a spread sheet instead of having to seek them out separately as is currently the case.

On a story like this, though, you can't follow the rules blindly. So at 12:17 p.m. -- long before T.J. Lane was charged but when editors had absolutely no doubt that the 17-year-old was the person who fired the deadly shots -- they posted the name on cleveland.com. That brought a few questions from readers who, reasonably, wanted to know why we had published his name before police officially announced it.
The departure of all three teams leaves Lotus with only two drivers using its engines to qualify for the 500 — Switzerland's Simona De Silvestro, who works for the one-car team of HVM Racing, and Jean Alesi, who was just added to the new Fan Force United team this week.

The base of Maker's Mark is essentially the only thing normal about the drink. The simple syrup has been infused with a chipotle kick, giving the drink a signature smokiness and heat. Mole bitters and a muddled orange wheel provide a heavy dose of citrus and spices. Even the garnish, traditionally a Maraschino cherry, has been replaced by the far superior Rainier cherry, which are soaked in bourbon to add tart, robust little bits of enjoyment. The sweetness, smokiness, strength of the bourbon and citrus notes all blend together to form a layered, well-accomplished drink with a kick of heat you'll want to spend your time enjoying.

Dotted throughout the south stands in Sunday's 27-13 Broncos loss to the Indianapolis Colts was something old-timers say you never used to see: jerseys of the opposing team. Numerous No. 18 Peyton Manning jerseys could be spotted frequently, and while that can be partially explained because of his immense stardom, old-time south stands fans say enemy laundry was unheard of in their day. If anybody was brave enough to wear some, they often were made to regret it.

She noted that Harris has set up a trial integrity unit, staffed by prosecutors, that is asking the Police Department about officers scheduled to testify in upcoming cases and disclosing their histories, when necessary, to defense lawyers.
I hate to decry a protest. It makes me feel old. Old people dismissed the civil rights movement and the protests against Vietnam as kids with nothing better to do making trouble in the street. I'm all for a good protest, and if the outraged were showing up en masse in May to demand national health care, or to fix immigration, I'd write a column urging everybody to take a day off and join them. But NATO? They're upset about NATO? Are you? Is anybody you know? I didn't think so.
Neither the United States nor Israel admits being behind a sabotage campaign that has made Iran's nuclear centrifuges unreliable, its computer software buggy and its precision steel defective. And the Obama administration has condemned the assassination plots, presumably the work of Israel, that have killed at least four Iranian nuclear scientists.

He is always bragging about the great things the city of St. Louis has to offer. I think St. Louis should know about one of her great sons."
It's hard to rate a show like this. While there were only two matches and one live promo, the show still felt worthwhile. Both matches were really strong, especially the main event, and the supplementary footage delivered. The Road to WrestleMania is coming to an end, and I'd say WWE has done a successful job building to Sunday's show. Most of the eight matches have developed stories behind them, which is great, as it makes every match feel more special. This year's WrestleMania has unrivaled potential, and I can't wait until Sunday to find out if it delivers.

We relaxed with a glass of Chilean Malbec while a guide gave us a menu of excursions for the week and asked about our wish list and fitness levels. We'd had visions of climbing volcanoes and even brought heavy-duty boots and down parkas.

We'd also need several days to acclimate to the altitude, which settled it.

Like almost all states, Illinois does not track the weapons' use by local police, and departments have been left to monitor and govern electroshock devices with a patchwork of policies.

The institutions recognized 10 years ago they have a joint, expanding role in the state's $5 billion ag industry, and that access to Portland's urban foodies and international connections was crucial.
Yes, I've taught now for more than 35 years. After I left McCluer, I taught at Ladue Chapel in the nursery school. The director, who became my mentor, was Mary Ross. She told me one day that if I wanted to succeed I would have to learn to talk. I came from a background where I used double negatives and my grammar was awful. I listened to her and paid attention to the way people around me spoke and to this day, I think that was one of the most important things anyone ever told me.

Mexico's reputation as a corrupt nation is well earned. Cash can only be passed if there is an outstretched palm. Still, how would Americans feel if they knew that bribes to their aldermen, mayors and zoning commissioners were responsible for the behemoth box store they didn't want in their neighborhood? Would they hold Wal-Mart blameless? Not likely.

But with al-Qaida members, Brennan goes on, "when considering lethal force we ask whether the individual poses a significant threat to U.S. interests." Except when the al-Qaida member is a U.S. citizen; then the standard narrows to "whether the individual poses an imminent treat of violent attack."

3. Mammograms -- This is a diagnostic tool in which x-rays are taken of your breast to reveal abnormal tissues. Mammograms can detect small breast tumors in two ways: Early breast cancers often leave tiny calcium deposits in the breast as cells die, and these can be seen on the mammograms. Other breast tumors are revealed by showing masses or shadows that look like white spots on an otherwise dark breast image. Either way, these mammogram changes can be the first signal that there may be abnormal cells developing in the breast.

We didn't abandon it, but it wasn't our day."

Without question, the movie is the most reverent work the irreverent Farrelly brothers have done, with nary a trace of the filmmakers' edgier side slipping into this family fare. For all the physical antics and the general stupidity that is a Stooges trademark, it's a strangely gentle comedy, not quite the ridiculous laugh riot fans of the trio might expect, but a very amusing escape from anything that resembles the real world.

But in the end, for me, the answer couldn’t be simpler, which is that there are some things you can’t support. … Politicians can’t take away our rights. We own those. They can’t act like that — in fact, the framers of the Constitution set it up the way they did precisely so they could not act like that.”

Since the 2001 attacks, the airport screening workforce has been entirely revamped and billions of dollars spent on technology that's been deployed across the country. But despite all the enhancements, there have been lapses. Most recently, a cellphone-size stun gun was found aboard a plane operated by JetBlue Airways Corp. Officials do not believe the stun gun was intended for use in some type of attack, but the FBI is investigating how and why it was on the airplane. And earlier this month, a Nigerian American was accused of breaching three layers of airport security while getting on a cross-country flight with an expired boarding pass.

The back story: For months, Cait had been clipping every photo she could find of the squished-face dogs. Every time she'd showed me another picture, I'd smile and say, "Not yet, honey." We were a one-parent, one-income family, and pugs aren't cheap.

In bonus-match action, Brodus Clay defeated his first real significant opponent since becoming the “Funkasaurus” in Dolph Ziggler, who bumped around the ring and made Brodus look like a million dollars in his offense. Elswehere, Ryback defeated two local talents in a handicap match. During the match, Chicago fans reminded us all how much of a wrestling enthusiast crowd they are by chanting “Goldberg” to Ryback.

One can't help noting what a singular time this is in terms of LGBT rights and acceptance in mainstream American society. On the one hand, state after state is approving same-sex marriage, celebrities from Ellen DeGeneres, Suze Orman and Neil Patrick Harris to "Glee's" Chris Colfer and Jane Lynch are completely and unashamedly out, and gay story lines regularly flow through mainstream films such as "Beginners" and TV shows like "Happy Endings." About 6,000 churches welcome LGBT members, and the military has finally dumped the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Bit by bit, the public message is not only that it gets better but perhaps even that it's no big deal.
Although the Champagne had been around for about 200 years, its market share in the United States was next to nil, Guiliano says. But over the next 20 years, with the paltriest of budgets, Guiliano promoted the heck out of the Champagne.

The Obama administration's mea culpa over the failure to prevent the attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner bound for Detroit on Christmas Day is understandable but misses the point. Yes, the United States can do better at catching would-be attackers; that will always be the case. But the truth is that there is no absolute security -- short of conceding victory to the terrorists by making it impossible for foreigners to visit the United States, hellish for Americans to fly and difficult for all to live normal lives.

Adding to my suspicions is the fact Rivers is in the area right now. The former USC standout, whom the Bengals selected ninth overall in 2008, tweeted to someone Tuesday night he’s “stopping in NYC” on his way back from a trip to France and Italy. Of course, if you follow his timeline, you’ll see he stopped here on the way out as well.

One underplayed aspect of Dungy's tenure was that while he was a longtime NFL defensive assistant and coordinator, he had been a quarterback at the University of Minnesota.

The play in question came in the fifth inning. The Royals led, 2-0, on Billy Butler's two-run homer in the first off Ubaldo Jimenez. There was one out and the Indians' defense shifted toward the right side of the diamond against left-handed hitting Alex Gordon, who sent a dribbler to the right of second base. It rolled slowly between shortstop Cabrera and second baseman Kipnis as they stopped to see if the other was going to make the play.

The performers bring their iconic roles to vibrant life: Greer infuses Faustus with a Jack Black-style manic energy; Mixon is dryly funny as the conflicted Luther, and McNall delivers an amusing counterpoint to the Hamlet he played far more seriously at the Pearl a few seasons back. Also fine is Joey Parsons in several female roles, including the Virgin Mary.

Riddle could potentially be a factor on either side of the ball, but he'll start out as a running back and return specialist. In an injury-shortened senior season, Riddle rushed for 917 yards and nine touchdowns on 111 carries, plus two catches for 46 yards and one TD. “He's self-motivated and brings an incredible talent level," said Linganore coach Rick Conner.

There have been many takes on aspirin therapy for women, partly because women respond to it differently than men. Current thinking: Women 55-79 who are at risk of "mini-strokes" (ischemic stroke) should take a low-dose baby aspirin every day. We say two baby aspirin (162 mg) with half a glass of water before and after. Its blood-thinning effects can cut the threat by 17 percent. Aspirin doesn't prevent strokes in men, but it lowers their heart-attack risk, which it doesn't for women under 65 (unless they've had one already).

The San Miguel Fire Protection District board of directors has a difficult task of deciding where the taxpayer's money is best spent. That money is what fills the water bucket of today. Some of the board members might feel that some of the necessary budget costs are simply a "drop in the bucket" and thus don't get reduced or eliminated. Please consider that each and every budget line item is actually a "hole in the bucket". These holes in the bucket start at the top and as the water drains there is little water left to Put out the fire.

The former No. 2 overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft wanted the ball and Collins wanted him to have it. He drove deep into the paint but Luol Deng was there to send his shot back. Turner got the offensive rebound and tried to gather himself, lost it, got in back again and went up into the body of the massive Omer Asik, virtually forcing Joey Crawford to blow the whistle.
The district will take a more aggressive approach to keep kids from leaving, Adams said. A team will go to Bunche, Stevens and Big Picture and begin recruiting them for other city schools.
The invitation for a lunch reception on June 28 at the Salem Golf Club described the Republican as a "two-tour Iraq War veteran" and "candidate for United States Senate."
She said Adams often used musical analogies when discussing photography, comparing a negative to a music score and the resulting photograph to the performance of the score.

The Supreme Court moved out in 1977. Its ornate courtroom on the second floor of the Capitol is now used for committee hearings. The vault where money and court records were kept is part of the House majority press and policy office, and soft drinks, paper plates and other items are stored inside it.
Not that every sack was the offensive line's fault, mind you. Jay Cutler held the ball too long at least twice and any criticism must also be cushioned by Mike Martz having enough trust in the line to let Cutler throw the ball downfield more often then he did after the offensive coordinator emphasized the running-and short-passing games during the bye week last year.

Schafers, however, cautioned that students who work outside the American university's study abroad office can run the risk of acquiring credits that will not transfer back to the student's school of choice. "On the internet there are program finders that students can use to find study abroad programs that meet their basic requirements, but not all of them are good. One of the main things I do, in assisting students, is determining if the credits they take abroad will be acceptable to Fontbonne." When students participate in the study abroad options sponsored by their American university that concern all but disappears.

Put all that together, it's going to be one crazy atmosphere, and our team is definitely going to be more than energized and ready to play that game."
I wonder if we will start to see a branding trend. Planning a wedding is a bit like running a business (or in this case, a pop-up shop) and having a clear mission and consistent message is Marketing 101. It gives the bride an outline for her wedding, and makes it easier to fill in the pieces, while keeping it personal.

He never cried out for help any more than he asked for it on the football field. He played hurt. He practiced as hard as he played and preached. He never - that's never - took a down off.

Hard to believe that, three years ago, the Thunder were a 23-win team that changed coaches during the season and finished last (yes, below the Timberwolves) in the division. But the team’s ascent has been quick and impressive—they’ve won 50 games each of the past two seasons and, last year, they took a major step forward by carrying their regular-season success into the playoffs, where they beat the Nuggets and Grizzlies before eventually losing to Dallas in the conference finals.
"I don't see that either, Sean," the governor said. But he "won't hesitate" to endorse a candidate in the Republican primary if he feels strongly about someone, he added.

was a college student whose life and linguistic skills straddled two cultures, a fitting metaphor for a suburban restaurant that offers Japanese menus for both East and West visitors. Basho does the usual suspects quite well, but do ask to see the a la carte menu, which features the more unusual and perhaps challenging dishes (salt-grilled beef tongue or veal liver sashimi or vinegared eel).

The pay-per-view contests weren't picked up by any of the networks that televise Big 12 games, so the only way they can be shown is on PPV because the conference's TV contracts prohibit its members from placing games on stations that compete with the league's TV partners. That negates the possibility of KPLR (Channel

I'm not the biggest fan of the horror genre, although I love "The Walking Dead" and "American Horror Story." But after watching both the hours that air tonight (the first of them twice), I find "The River" to be a slow slog through a ridiculous plot, with unappealing characters (except for Hope) and tired camera tricks. Even the exotic setting is wasted as scenes alternate between hand-held camera footage and what looks like security-cam tapes. The series is also heavily subtitled, if that bothers you.
You've gotten all sorts of honorary degrees and lifetime achievement awards. Other than the obvious emotions -- gratitude, pride -- how do you feel about receiving them? Does it make you feel a little posthumous sometimes?
As for Herman Cain, his hopes of winning the nomination were a fantasy from the beginning, and his problems are damaging because they strike on multiple fronts. He seems not to have known that China is a long-established nuclear power.

He was unacquainted with the neoconservative branch of the conservative movement.

And divorced parents' income was only about half that of their married peers. Even divorced parents who remarry end up contributing less, meeting just 53 percent of their children's needs and contributing only 5 percent of their income, even though remarried parents' incomes rose to about the same level of parents who stayed in their original marriages.

With the space-shuttle program ended, NASA either must find someone to lease major buildings - such as the facility where workers repaired shuttle tiles - or abandon them, because the cash-strapped agency lacks the money to demolish them.

"That's sad to me if that happens," Adelman, 64, said of the Kings' possible move. "It would be a shame because the people there, like the fans in Portland, that's their team. That's what they have.

With a willing General Assembly -- stress on "willing" -- and assuming a governor doesn't worry about re-election, there's not much an Ohio governor can't do. And if voters make Kasich governor, there's a good chance they'd also give Ohio a Republican-run state House of Representatives, led by Medina conservative William G. Batchelder. But changing the Statehouse's population doesn't change Ohio's population.
In one of the best sight gags of the fast-moving performance (the show runs about an hour with no intermission), a walking shower with curtain -- I won't insult your intelligence by naming the classic horror movie it references -- tries to make its way onto the stage, knocking into walls along the way.

Today, we have Republican presidential candidates attacking the free market, private enterprise and the capitalists who invest in America. One demands a halt to immigration. Others spent years on Capitol Hill or as K Street lobbyists while portraying fellow candidates as "career politicians." All of them claim to be the true heirs to Ronald Reagan's legacy, even as they violate Reagan's "11th Commandment": "Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican."
It is unclear, Mayberg says, whether these effects are related to the stimulation or merely reflect the progression of the disorder.
Okay, so owners Andy Ivanov and Ladi Sebestyan may have a tough time convincing the mass-brew swilling demographic to switch over to German and craft beers. You won’t find Coors, Miller or Bud in this bar; the 20 beers on tap are German, Czech, Belgian and Austrian, with the exception of Ramstein Oktoberfest, from High Point Brewing in Butler. The 50 or so bottles on hand are a diverse roundup of American craft and imported brews.

It was all enough to keep the Blazers on the heels of the playoff-bound Clippers all night. In fact, at one point in the first half, the Blazers went on a 15-0 run and led 35-25.

It wasn't easy as the Toreros (32-10, 9-4 WCC) tried to rally against Kraus in the top of the ninth. Down 5-2, San Diego got its first two runners of the inning on base with back-to-back singles. Corey LeVier then blooped a single to shallow center field that dropped just out of the reach of Michael Lucarelli, Portland's shortstop. Kris Bryant advanced to second base on the hit, while Jon Hotta came around to score, making it a two-run ballgame.
"I tried to be very sensitive to that, to the fact that in the primary, everyone had voted for someone other than me," she said. "But we knew the rest of the ticket was from Cook County.

This dressing goes well with roast chicken or turkey dinners. You can start saving and drying tortillas and biscuits or bread the week before. Use absolutely the whitest, softest bread you have -- conventional hamburger and hotdog buns are good for this. Serve with plenty of turkey pan drippings or gravy. This becomes a substantial vegetarian dish if you use mushroom stock and leave out the bacon.

Break it down: Several 10-minute bouts of exercise can be as effective as one 30-minute workout. Olson suggests starting with 10 minutes of something like walking or basic yoga. After two weeks, add on another 10 minutes -- and know that you can do the additional 10 minutes later in the day. In another week, tack on 10 more minutes of something moderately physical so that you are accumulating 30 minutes most days of the week.

As this plays out in the campaign, Obama will have numbers on his side: high poll numbers among Hispanic voters, the high number of deportations his administration has done and, now, the numbers showing that illegal immigration may be a problem that is slowly but steadily going south.
Solution: A healthy and productive season by Ubaldo Jimenez would go a long way to improve a rotation that ranked 10th in the AL in ERA (4.51) and innings pitched (961 1/3). Justin Masterson and Josh Tomlin must build on their 12-win season from 2011 and Lowe cannot resemble the 17-game loser from Atlanta. Hernandez, Slowey, Jeanmar Gomez, Zach McAllister, David Huff and Scott Barnes should give Acta enough arms to cover the fifth spot.

"It’s a global business now," agrees Dergarabedian. "And also, at home, we’re living in a world of video games, and the net, and that’s changed forever how people consume and view entertainment. I mean today, compared to ‘Fast Five,’ ‘The French Connection’ would be considered a post-modern, European-style thriller. … Adult dramas — well, I don’t think Hollywood’s ever going to stop making them. But they’re only going to make them at the right price."

Then comes the ugliness. Decades after the Ford plant -- once the largest car-manufacturing site in the United States -- closed, what was once vibrant paint destined to add gloss to shiny cars stayed behind to poison the environment, where chunks of discarded sludge are still mixed in with the foliage.

"Ideally, my originals have strong roots in the blues but also have something unexpected, like a chord change or voicing that takes it on a jag to left field, but not so far that you get uneasy," Cobb said. "Also from growing up with the Beatles, I love bridges. That is to say, most straight ahead blues is a 12 bar pattern that stays the same through the whole song. Lennon and McCartney and their disciples tend to have an 'A' section and a bridge called a 'B' section that takes you somewhere else for a bit. Some of their songs even have a 'C' section which is even cooler. I would never hold myself up to that skill level but those are my influences!"

Coach, can you talk about Nebraska’s running game? And, as a follow up, were you aware Sandusky was committing heinous felonies on young boys in your locker room?
"Sweet Thunder" is by far the best of these books and, in describing an athlete now universally acknowledged as the greatest prizefighter who ever lived, better also than Robinson's own collaborative autobiography. Anyone who ever saw him in the ring, or has watched a film of one of his bouts, understands why boxing fans paradoxically insist on calling their sport "the sweet science." Because his professional record included multiple welter- and middleweight titles and a stunning overall record of 174-19-6, it's often unappreciated that Robinson was, along with Jesse Owens, the greatest amateur athlete of the 20th century. He won all 85 of his amateur fights, 69 by knockout, 40 in the first round.

Her love of stories started long before that. Ochsner's mother had been a high school teacher who loved Shakespeare and passed that love on to her daughter. Like so many bookish kids, Ochsner dreamed of being a librarian or working in a bookstore, a job where someone would pay her to read all day. Reading is almost always the basis for wanting to write; telling and writing stories grows out of hearing and reading them.

Try the black bean sauce noodles, even if the server warns you off -- "You know they're made with fermented soybeans, right?" Well, yes, but this version is light on funk and heavy with hearty pork lardons. Tucked under the seething black morass, the off-white noodles seem almost naked, but stir them through the sauce, its flavor more in line with a rich peanut butter sauce or mole, and you have a great dish.

By a near-party-line 51-45 tally, senators voted to keep the bill alive but fell nine votes short of the 60 needed to continue debate.

-- Add some fenders. Bike fenders are your best friend for wet weather riding. Fenders start at around $20, a small price to pay for keeping dry. Unless you're riding a super-light road bike, you probably won't even notice the extra few grams of weight that your fenders add. Plenty of San Francisco cyclists keep fenders on all year.

In turn, Pau Gasol (13 points, eight boards) and Jordan Hill (10 points, 10 rebounds) became trusty options when Bynum wasn't open.

It's not just about pictures. And that's part of the interaction. This building will make the other buildings appear also fantastic, and that's what architecture should do. It should not just be about itself as a stand-alone phenomenon, but how does it contribute to the whole neighborhood?

My advice for any pedestrian is always the same: You’ve got to make eye contact with drivers before you cross a street.”

The industry knows that "all of your apps and data are available to you wherever you are and on every device you own" produces tasty stuff; now, they're allowing their imaginations to run with the idea and they're figuring out different ways that it can enhance different things. So it's like a circular-immersion circulator, only with bandwidth issues.

About 12 miles from Six Flags, the sounds of teenage chatter turned to screams of panic after the bus slammed into a pickup and was immediately struck from behind by another school bus. The force of the collision threw Emily into the air and pinned her against the seat in front of her.
At this point I would settle for Major League Soccer and minor league baseball on the banks of the Willamette River. What locals should never settle for, however, is political incompetence -- worse yet, indifference. If nothing else, can we please dump the "Aw-shucks-we'll-never-get-anything-done-here" attitude. I'm not asking for moral perfection from our leaders, but I would appreciate a little intestinal fortitude from City Hall.
Spend an afternoon in Bernal, and the nickname makes sense. There's an infinite variety of pre- and post-natal yoga classes at Bernal Yoga; a store that sells recycled children's clothing, toys, and baby gear; live music for kids at the Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center on Saturday mornings; a grocery store that showcases kids' artwork on its bulletin board; and a seemingly endless supply of posters for the Maternity Xchange on telephone poles that are now brainwashing me, through sheer repetition, into thinking I should be buying maternity clothes.
The Kevin Kline Award-winner stars in the first show, "Little Shop of Horrors," as Seymour, the hapless florist raising a plant with peculiar appetites. Next comes "The Drowsy Chaperone," in which he's one of the dancing gangsters. In "Guys and Dolls" he'll play Rusty Charlie, one of the Runyonesque characters who opens the show with the great "Fugue for Tinhorns"; since Rusty Charlie doesn't have much to do after that impressive opening, Nordstrom's also understudying some of the other parts. And he'll change theatrical hats to direct this summer's children's show at Stages, "Disney's Alice in Wonderland."
David Steele, FanHouse: "All this news about the Saints' bounties, and the Redskins' bounties, and the Titans' bounties, and the players gleefully and smugly acknowledging how long it's been going on and how widespread it's always been … this is good. For every follower of the NFL, fanatic or casual, these revelations are extremely welcome. The hypocrisy can now end, and honesty can see the light of day. The NFL, its coaches, executives and especially its players can now stop the double-talk, the phoniness and the excuse-making. They can all face who and what they really are, and the fans can face them, too-and the fans, in turn, can face who they are. Nary a one of them gives half a damn about the players' health, safety and long-term well-being. In that light, here's hoping those extra $1,500 the players earned some afternoon when they gave that extra-hard body-slam to some vulnerable receiver, will buy them that extra day in the assisted-living facility they'll be needing in about 30 years. If they make it that far."
As envisioned, the project will be paid for in large part by taxpayers. The state will contribute $50 million from the sale of bonds. Another $60 million will also come from bond issuances in which OHSU, OSU and PSU will pay the debt service, OHSU's Williams said.

Sunday afternoon at Arco Arena  um, Power Balance Pavilion  was eerily reminiscent of the days when the Kings were good and the Maloofs were flush. The announced crowd of 16,012 directed its venom at the Portland Trail Blazers, for the most part internalizing or ignoring the ongoing spat about the downtown arena proposal that collapsed late last week.

My gradeschool garden girlfriend Molly helps in the strawberry patch that has been overrun by quack grass. I ask what she would like us to grow this year. Basil, she suggests, not worried about choosing between bush and Genovese, and not making the leap to future berries tossed with aged balsamic vinegar and a few fragrant leaves of her crop sliced thin.
The result: standardized test scores that are among the highest in the city, far above those in surrounding schools. There is little evidence that Synergy achieves this by handpicking star students. Many parents say they enrolled their children at Synergy specifically because they were failing at a nearby school. (Like many charters, however, Synergy has a lower percentage of special education students than the average Los Angeles public school.)
"I think we showed the rest of the field that we have a car that has good speed," he said. "I want those guys to see that we've got strength.

Pulverize the cumin and coriander seeds in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle; place in bowl with the chickpeas, olive oil, chile powder and salt and pepper. Stir well. Spread in a single layer on a baking sheet and place the oven. Roast until the chickpeas are beginning to be golden brown in spots and some to split, about 15-20 minutes; shake or stir occasionally. Taste to check for doneness. For crisper chickpeas, roast another 5-10 minutes, but be careful not to burn them. Place in a bowl, sprinkle with more salt and pepper, if desired, and serve hot or warm.
“I think so,” Sowell responded nonchalantly, according to Ross’ testimony.
Once the EEOC formally asks for a rehearing, the three judges who originally heard the case could decide to take another look, a majority of the 11 active judges on the court could decide to take up the case, or the court can outright deny the request.

Background: I grew up in a small town in Ohio. After graduating from college, I handled an outside sales territory in New England for a national manufacturing company. A territory change brought me to Iowa in the late 1980s. In the mid-90s, my employer was purchased by a larger corporation, and I knew it was time for a change. Drake University Law School offered me a full-ride scholarship, and three years later I went into practice for a law firm in Des Moines, doing mostly civil litigation. Once again, I felt the direction shifting and knew it was time to make another change. In 2011, I started my own law firm.
The brothers have renovated a bit, but the tavern retains its Old West charm. A large stone fireplace dominates the front room, and along one wall a glass case protects hotel guest books that date to the early 1900s. A cozy bar gives the impression of a warm and inviting waystation.

While Klinsmann hasn't committed to Herc or Wondo, he has gone all in with Shea. Although the 22-year-old hasn't played to the level he showed last summer, when he emerged as an MLS MVP candidate, Shea has been a mainstay for Klinsmann and clearly offers qualities the coach appreciates. His ability to stretch defenses along the flank is a valuable asset, and Klinsmann has invested considerable time in bringing the player along.

Many would argue that the charitable deduction should also be excluded from the cap.

Coming from an hour away, there are ample ways to get to the stadium, but I drive a very convoluted course to arrive there.

In her new book, "Skinnydipping," Frankel takes the advice "write what you know" seriously with a thinly veiled protagonist who closely resembles herself.

The Celtics were the better team in the series, which isn't breaking news. They had a better plan, better poise, way better execution. If the Cavs had given better focus and better effort in Games 2, 4 and 5, then they might have had a chance to stretch it out. But none of the four losses were truly close.

I think of "Cat in the Rain," perhaps my favorite of his stories, which in three concise pages portrays a marriage on the cusp of unraveling, without ever making that overt. The young American wife at the center of the narrative is dissatisfied but only aware of it as an undertone. As her husband reads, uninterested, she stares out the window of their Italian hotel room, then tries to rescue a cat caught in the rain. The story unfolds over the course of only a few minutes, but these minutes are intensely weighted, especially when the wife goes downstairs and runs into the hotel-keeper, an older man who is everything her husband is not. "The wife liked him," Hemingway writes. "She liked the deadly serious way he received any complaints. She liked his dignity. She liked the way he wanted to serve her. She liked the way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands."

The moral dimension is missing from the hero, a 17-year-old peasant boy, but not from Louis Malle's profound study of guilt and innocence in occupied France. Lucien, played by Pierre Blaise, is an emotional and cultural infant.

A more accessible film on the same subject, "Au Revoir Les Enfants" grew out of Malle's experience as a young student at a private school, on the grounds of a Carmelite monastery, that sheltered Jewish students from Nazi deportation.

The film's a passable B-grade spy-flick divertissement -- but its script, look, editing, music, action choreography, grim tone and cynical view of the bureaucrats who run the espionage game seem so blatantly lifted (intentionally or not) from the last two "Bourne" movies, you wonder if they had DVDs on set for reference.

Brown indicated at the beginning of the season that he didn't care about playoff seeding so long as his team peaked and remained healthy when the postseason began. Still, the team's development correlated with the wins anyway. Two months ago, the Lakers sat in seventh place in the West and faced all kinds of challenges. The Lakers went on a 13-game stretch where they didn't score more than 100 points in a game. The constant change of the rotations left both players uncomfortable with their role and Brown unsure of what he had. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum carried most of the load, and logged heavy minutes with it. And the team's bench remained last in the league in both points per game and efficiency.

Revascularization, which is re-establishing blood flow, can be done in a variety of ways. When you had a bypass graft, was one of your blood vessels used for the bypass? I take it that it was. Artificial grafts have long been used as a way to "bypass" the clog and establish circulation between the upper and lower unclogged portions of the artery. Dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene are two artificial materials used to re-establish flow through the artery. They work well. After one year from installation of an artificial graft, the artery is wide open 90 percent of the time. After five years, it's open 70 percent to 80 percent of the time.

In my Indy experience, no.

1. HOLLIDAY SPENDING: The biggest development for the Cardinals in 2010 was also the biggest contract (so far) in Cardinals history. Matt Holliday agreed to a seven-year, $120-million contract last January that is the richest the franchise has ever completed.

Holliday was the only outfielder in the NL to rank in the top 10 in average, on-best percentage and slugging. The year ends with Holliday making another move. Holliday, embracing the role as a franchise fixture, has brought his family north to call the St. Louis area home.

But art was in his DNA. His father was a small-time poet and brush-and-ink calligrapher; and his mother, though not an artist herself, was a superstitious, temple-going, incense-burning woman whose spirituality influenced her son.

The German equivalent of "Shakespeare in Love," this glossy, uncomplicated and modestly enjoyable historical romance imagines the real-life love triangle that inspired "Young Werther in Love," the book that made aspiring poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe a literary sensation in the 1770s. As imagined by director and co-writer Phillipp Stözel, young Goethe (Alexander Fehling) is a brash, creative, somewhat scattered lad whose irreverent, carousing ways don't go over well in the backwater town in which he toils as a lowly law clerk. The story indulges in the usual romance tropes once Goethe and his dour but well-connected boss become unwitting competitors for the hand of the same woman. It's a fluffy but agreeable picture, although Fehling hardly evinces Goethe's powerful intellect.

Because all the networks are owned by a handful of corporations and everyone's looking for advertising dollars, there are some topics they won't touch. When I was making Crude, everyone was afraid of offending Chevron. There are many opportunities to do branded content, which is advertiser-driven reality television. I'm not knocking it because Iconoclasts is made possible by Grey Goose Vodka. It's been a wonderful partnership. They've been very wise about letting us do what we do. It is paid for by a brand, though, and they do get advertising advantages.

How about The Comics Curmudgeon? Josh Fruhlinger makes daily comic strips like "Mary Worth" and "Mark Trail" readable and enjoyable the only way that any mortal man can: by mocking them. This involves reproducing the strip he's making fun of. Okay, he's definitely downloading and re-hosting content . . . but it's a form of commentary and parody. We're all thinking "protected under the ‘fair use' exceptions of copyright law" here, right?

The report will help determine whether PG&E should be fined for its incompetence leading up to the San Bruno blast, which killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes.

Ochsner went to McKay High School and Salem Academy before studying secondary education at George Fox College in Newberg. Part of the English component was a creative-writing class, and she says Ed Higgins, the instructor, tricked the students into writing short stories by telling them to pretend to have characters and then put them in a scene. Before they knew it, they were writing a story. She loved it and wanted to study writing after graduating from George Fox but knew she didn't have the skills.

Which is what Tuck will do Sunday. He again declared his hatred for the Cowboys — “What am I supposed to say?” he said. “That I want to play for them?” — but he hates losing more. The reminders of that Super Bowl upset are everywhere he looks on the walls at the Giants training complex, and no, they’re not black and white photos.

Those are some of the responses New Jersey residents gave when we asked them to sum up the state of affairs as 2012 gets underway. (Oh, and there was high praise for Cuban cigars and tips on where to get a deal on cases of canned tomatoes for the Sunday gravy as well. This is New Jersey, after all.)
To be fair, the 240-yard hole was playing tough, second on this day only to No. 1. But 41 of the 63 players in the final round managed to make par by aiming at the green, and only one player beside Mickelson made worse than bogey. His triple bogey on the way to a final-round 72 was the worst score of the day on the hole, not that they give out any awards for that.

Widespread robo-signing that stretches back a decade or more could create problems for homeowners.

Recalling the workouts - low reps with heavy weights - makes him groan.
But every generation needs to find its own outlaws. And by the wild energy of the mostly under-30 crowd - possibly disconnected from the country pap of the latest Brad-Kenny McPaisney, or the navel-gazing emo-rock of whiny guys with bad haircuts - it's clear that Eric Church aims to fill those boots for some time to come.

Justice Paul Pfeifer, a Republican former state lawmaker, questioned whether the constitution expressly prohibited Republicans from drawing a map to their advantage.

For example, put five charms spread out along the bottom chain, four in the center and three along the top. Once you settle on a pattern, use the pliers to attach the 5 mm jump rings to the chains. Make sure the jump rings are closed tight so the charms will not fall off.
Totenberg's violin teaching career was almost as long as his life.
Where, exactly, the god of love hangs out describes Amy Bloom's oeuvre well. She claimed the topic as uniquely her own in 1993 with "Come to Me," a short story collection and National Book Award finalist.

Now imagine turning around and looking in exactly the opposite direction, 180 degrees away from the core. This “anti-center” point is visible in the winter and early spring.

With the early days of winter weather upon us in Sacramento and in the Sierra, it's worth assessing the recent history of good, old-fashioned wool  how it nearly got muscled out of the way by those new- fangled fabrics that attempted to do some of the things  but not everything  wool has always done.

Theriot shrugged off the Cubs' bluster, insisting they saw a sting to his comments that wasn't intended. Whatever the Windy City fallout, the whole exchange and the Cubs' Benedict Arnold reaction helped illustrate the malleability of a word Theriot mentioned often Saturday: loyalty. Theriot had a prickly start to 2010 when he and the Cubs went to arbitration to determine his salary. The process - already caustic because it pits the team against the player - was further troublesome for Theriot because he had wanted a commitment from the Cubs beyond the one year arbitration mandates.
"It's criminal," Nance said. "It's gross negligence. They really need to get their computer system squared away."
-- More phone choices for T-Mobile subscribers. T-Mobile, as a much smaller carrier than AT&T, doesn't get as many exclusives on top-line phones, and it doesn't have the iPhone. This won't be a big benefit to T-Mobile subscribers who don't have contracts -- if they want the iPhone today, they can sign up with AT&T or Verizon Wireless. But subscribers under contract would find it easier to upgrade to an iPhone.

"Keep in mind, virtually all of the stored carbohydrates are in the stems that you're removing," Grummons says. "They're not down in the roots. That's a huge misconception. The plant stores carbohydrates in the dormant buds along the stems. If you cut out all that, where's the plant going to get the energy to come back?"

“Any prudent person would question why people feel the need to carry a firearm into an establishment – especially one that predominantly serves alcohol,” he said. “Law enforcement is always apprehensive about these laws.”
State Transportation Commissioner Jim Simpson was so unnerved by the deaths of the two teens in Wayne — and another teen walking on tracks in Garfield the next day — that he formed a committee of transit experts to look for ways to decrease fatalities at rail crossings. Thirty people died in New Jersey last year after being struck by NJ Transit or Amtrak trains.
"The River Plan pushes our planning envelope, and its success will be measured by the jobs created and the habitat restored," Mayor Sam Adams said in a news release touting the River Plan after its unanimous approval.
That left open nearly all the traditional crab grounds outside the Golden Gate. Crabbers from Oregon and other areas took advantage, bagging fresh Dungeness, some of which found its way into local markets.

"We've actually talked about, in a crazy way — you can't do it, but what if our center position was like hockey?" Nuggets coach George Karl said. "Four- or five-minute stints, just run, run, run, run. Next guy, run, run, run, run. Because I know Bynum and Gasol don't want to run, run, run, run for 48 minutes. We can't do that probably, but we actually talked about instead of playing guys 10 minutes (each), shortening it to six, seven minutes."
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The Jacksonville Jaguars have given cornerback Aaron Ross permission to miss part of training camp to attend the Olympics and watch his wife run.
The Angels are looking for much of the same. After all, they have been to just one World Series in their 52-season history. Pujols has been to three in 11 years.
The show does start, after all, in a school setting.
The record will show that James rushed 30 times for 239 yards against the Bears. He scored one touchdown. And he went over 4,000 yards in his college career. But what he served as mostly against Cal, and on most other game nights, was the role of a player so gifted with a football in his hands that he covers up weaknesses and deficiencies.
Baseball -- Today, Saturday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday 8 a.m.
By Frida Ghitis
Basketball purists may argue Duke-North Carolina or Kansas-Missouri are the game's biggest, most intense rivalries. But those are like quaint tea parties compared with the animosity between Kentucky and Louisville, which required government intervention to get them to schedule each other.
High schools were given an average of $120,000 apiece to design their own approaches to helping these students. Some schools used the money to reduce class sizes in ninth grade and asked their best teachers to teach them. Others assigned blocks of freshmen to a common set of core academic teachers who met together to monitor their progress. Still others appointed adult mentors to conduct daily or weekly check-ins with the shakiest students.

The CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament championship kicks off at 7 p.m. at Livestrong Sporting Park, which might as well have been a considerably more cozy and modern version of Mexico City’s famous Estadio Azteca given the overwhelming crowd support from green-clad, flag-waving Mexican fans during a 3-1 semifinals win against Canada.

But those numbers, compiled by the U.S. Department of Education for the 2007-08 school year, fail to account for a significant number of Oregon students who transfer from community colleges to four-year universities or who move among the Oregon University System's seven campuses, said Robert Kieran, assistant vice chancellor for institutional research.

Gérard Mulot: "You can diet in your own country," Françoise Renauldon said as she handed over a chocolate and basil muffin. The astringent basil did a fox trot on my tongue with the dark but not-too-sweet chocolate enrobed in a rich yellow cake.
For decades, residents of Gozo -- they're called Gozitans -- were ordered to spend every night within the fortress walls. Today, these walls hold museums of archaeology, folklore, natural science and church history, the latter of which is next to the Cathedral of the Assumption, built from 1697 to 1711. After visiting the cathedral, I toured its museum, and was curious about a small but amusing collection of papal shoes.
“The only difference is the husband was not alive when he donated the sperm,” she said. “But should that deprive the child of the benefits of being his father’s son?”
Vintage-inspired blue, green and rose washes are among the most popular.
The developer building a medical mart and convention center in downtown Cleveland is selling off similar marketplaces across the country. But Cuyahoga County officials say the $465 million, taxpayer-financed project here remains a priority for Chicago-based MMPI.

If the change is approved, it would mean an increase in nightly fees of about $4 to $6 dollars for the average senior or person with a disability. But then there's the principle of the thing.
Second, supporters of the public bridge predict traffic volumes will rise to new peak levels in the next 25 years, leading to congestion unless capacity is added. This is a hotly disputed point. Moroun points out that the volume of border crossings plummeted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Traffic has been rising as the economy picks up, but it's still only a little more than half of the totals of the late 1990s. Passenger-car traffic is down more sharply than truck traffic, as more stringent border security measures apparently have discouraged casual visitors.
It all helped to varying degrees, and with the Nuggets down two games in the series has at least given them something to build on going into Friday night's Game 3 at the Pepsi Center.

America is diverse, and so is this examination of its religions. "American Grace" will very likely be the standard work on this important subject for a long time.
• Carmelo Anthony can only do so much. If the Knicks are going to come back against the heavily favored Heat, they'll need more 3-pointers from Steve Novak and J.R. Smith, wrote George Willis of the New York Post: "Smith has led the Knicks reserves in scoring, totaling 30 points in the two playoff games, not a bad effort considering part of his duties has included guarding LeBron James... But Novak has been silenced by the Heat defense, scoring six points in Game 1 and just three points in Game 2. Overall, Novak has taken just five shots in the two games, making three, all from 3-point range, this after averaging six shots per game during the regular season."
She also strictly avoids phrases like "golden ager" or "80 years young." They may be intended to flatter, but Bennett sees them as infantilizing and ageist. She approves of the matter-of-fact "old people," though dismisses "older people" as "namby-pamby." But "elder" is her default term. Though to some it connotes village or tribal societies, she points out that modern Americans routinely use it in terms like "eldercare" and "elder abuse."
Simin has beauty on her side, though not always unvarnished truth when she's working her marital stratagems. Nader comes on as a hard case, slow to smile and quick to criticize; only gradually does he reveal warmth and humor, along with a willingness to fudge crucial facts when coming clean might court disaster that he doesn't deserve. The caregiver, Razieh, is a picture of piety—literally so, since she has the face of a Madonna—but the secrets she chooses to keep may destroy lives. The daughter, Termeh, watches and listens while seeking her own truth in what ultimately becomes a chastening story of her coming of age. Razieh's husband, Hodjat, emerges as the film's most frightening presence and yet, at one and the same time, its most compelling figure. He comes on as a religious fanatic, but what we learn about him illuminates, ever so affectingly, the fundamental separation in today's Iran between the secular bourgeois class and the religious working class.
There is no doubt in my mind that we, as a country and as a people, are up for the challenge. Our democracy is strong; our economy is the world’s largest. Innovation and risk-taking is in our collective DNA. There is no better place for investment. Above all, we have a demonstrated record as a people and a nation of rising up to meet challenges.

In announcing that she was charging George Zimmerman with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, special prosecutor Angela B.

Alternatively, the skewers can be cooked on a medium-high grill for about 3 minutes per side. Be sure to coat the grill grates liberally with cooking spray. When grilling, the skewers can be inserted prior to cooking. Avoid this when using the broiler; the more intense heat of the broiler will burn the skewers.
I ordered a mandarin orange vodka and soda and had a seat to try and figure out the place. Manilow's is ostensibly a gay/lesbian night club, albeit one with some unusual features. On this particular night, a drag queen show was under way, with performers singing and dancing energetically to classic tunes. The flashing stage lights and professional audio setup seemed slightly at odds with the pool tables, dart boards and other trappings of your typical neighborhood bar. If the dance floor wasn't in the middle of it all, you probably wouldn't peg the place as a club at all.
And exploring a single subject so long and so deeply requires an older person's patience and perspective.

Attorney General Tom Horne tried to revive a bill that would have allowed the police force in Colorado City to be replaced with Mohave County sheriff's deputies. The measure is needed, Horne and advocates say, because the marshals in Colorado City are still loyal to Warren Jeffs, the imprisoned former president of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and not to the principles of law enforcement.
Dec. 28, 2010 — Phylicia Barnes, visiting from Monroe, N.C., is last seen in her sister's apartment in the 6500 block of Eberle Drive, near the Reisterstown Road Metro station and shopping plaza. When her sister, Deena, can't locate her, family members call police. Deena's ex-boyfriend, Michael Johnson, is the last person to see her alive, reporting that he saw her asleep on the couch as he moved out of the apartment.

Matt Bracken: Terps offensive coordinator Mike Locksley apparently declined to compare Cockerille to any other quarterback he's seen, but the Greyhounds junior said offensive line coach Tom Brattan was reminded of a certain miracle-working signal-caller in New York. “Coach Brattan actually was like, ‘I’m gonna call you Tebow. Does anyone ever call you Tebow?’ I just laughed. I get that a lot,” Cockerille said. Comparing Cockerille to Tebow is apples and oranges; the latter was a consensus five-star prospect with offers from every major college football program in the country, while the former is a three-star recruit that picked Maryland over Navy, Temple and Virginia. The comparison presumably stems from size – Cockerille is 6-2, 210 pounds, Tebow is 6-3, 236 pounds – strength, running style and toughness. Cockerille is a pro-style passer who did more running (1,300 yards on the ground) than passing (1,100 yards through the air) in 2011. But the fact that Maryland prioritized a guy like Cockerille -- who also wrestles at Gilman and was recruited by Michigan as a safety -- at quarterback is telling. This Terps coaching staff, which also targeted a notably physical QB prospect last year in all-state wrestler Perry Hills, wants gritty, brawny passers who can run and won't be overwhelmed physically. In Cockerille, Maryland got a guy who fits that profile to a T.

This is very serious and we see the ultimate consequence of these actions in failed ministries and damaged people. I believe that most people who are compelled but not called do so out of a desire to serve God; I believe that they have gifts and talents (i.e. preaching, prophetic, administrative) that are essential to the proper operation of a church or ministry, but that doesn’t mean they are called to be a Pastor, Prophet, Apostle, Teacher or Evangelist.

Any way I'm sure I'm not the only one that has had to cross this path at some stage. I told my daughter that I was trying to make it easier on them for when I died. She said that they will still probably fight over some of my goodies. *Laughs* Below is a collection of photos that I took so that you can see my befores and afters. I thought that a little plan of the garage might help you better visualize just how it all fits into my box.
Fourteen days into my healthy eating plan I’m reminded that weight loss is more about facing my inner demons than simply giving up my favourite foods. I found the courage to step onto the dreaded scales. Following this ordeal were three days of intense detoxing as I learnt to live again without caffeine, wine and processed food. The first afternoon after work was the worst. With a throbbing headache I opened the fridge eagerly reaching for the chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, and found my hand shaking in anticipation. My trembling hand shocked me as I’d never considered that I may actually be dependent on my evening glass of wine. I reluctantly closed the fridge door. I am not only fighting the ’fatty-boom-bah’ war, but a battle with my addictions as well!
In fact, parenting with all of the above may actually guarantee that your children are more likely to struggle in many different ways through out their life than children who are parented unconditionally with respect and freedom, who don't go to school, and who are supported in following their natural patterns of learning and exploring their interests and passions.
UPDATE II: A perusal of the Facebook group in questions reveals that 1) the group allows the addition of registered Facebook users to the group by other members with or without their explicit consent, 2) members have stated that they have done so, and 3) I just added someone else to the group without his or her consent as a test. So take any membership numbers touted by the group with extreme suspicion and skepticism.

It has meant getting up and out. It has meant jumping on the trampoline for an hour with my 5 y.o. instead of “working on the computer”. And let’s be honest here. “Working on the computer” is a never-ending to do for me. So an hour away is nothing.
I eat right, I workout 5 days a week, but I swear, like other girls, I can pick out 20 things I find wrong with myself. I listen to my friends and family do the same thing and I always think- "you are crazy girl, I dont know what mirror you are looking at!" But then I cant say the same to myself. I am sure its the week prior to my lovely time of the month when I am ALWAYS criticizing every inch of my body, but its starting to drive me nuts. I can go from being super confident one day, to the exact opposite the next.

I even went so far as to create my own little rose using the Tattered Pine Cone die.

I actually managed to do it without the toothpick so that is even better for me as I rarely have then around and when I do, my boys think it's time to play with them and they disappear again! Simply adorable and seeing as I LOVE adding flowers to projects, it's good to know I will never have to hunt for that perfect flower again as I can create my own co-ordinating ones with ease.

I started at my house and ran to my gym where I did about 40 minutes of strength training and then I ran home. I'm so used to trying to cram runs into a limited amount of time that I had to keep reminding myself that I had all the time in the world. There was no reason I had to run fast. There was no reason I had to rush. Which I think is why my pace graph looks like an EKG. I'd catch myself speeding up and then try and slow down. Over and over again. Maybe some day I'll actually learn how to pace myself.

4. Stand Out From The Crowd – The world despises a cheap imitation and loves an original. Conformity to the norm will merely sentence you to mediocrity, obsolescence, and irrelevance. Everyone has unique gifts and talents, and the earlier you discover and develop yours the better off you’ll be. Build your personal brand, become a subject matter expert, and guard your reputation. Everyone has a personal brand – the question is will it be built by default or by design. Everything you do should enhance and reinforce your story.

The main improvement initiative I’m undertaking currently is to pick up things that have fallen on the ground. I’m still okay with stuff that’s supposed to be down there — pebbles, earthworms, the drunken homeless — but I’m trying to put forth a real effort to make my world a better place with the simple act of bending down and retrieving discarded litter. Some people have chosen to help earthquake victims; I’m thinking that charity begins at home, in an approximately three-foot radius of where I’m standing.

Given their abandonment by the legal system and the antagonism or apathy of most whites, it’s not surprising that blacks took the lead in the quest to end racism. Figures like Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B.

I spent some time as a child idolizing America’s Founding Fathers. This was in part because I have a genealogical relationship with one and in part because I lived in southern Virginia where, if you want to, you can feel a strong residue of the American Revolution and the early years of the United States all over the place. I certainly did. I learned early on that the state motto, “Sic Semper Tyrannis” or “thus always to tyrants,” was adopted as a direct challenge to King George III and the British Parliament. I was very proud that Virginians wrote the Declaration of Independence (Thomas Jefferson), commanded the Continental Army (George Washington), and crafted the Bill of Rights (James Madison). I enjoyed visiting places like Monticello (the home of Thomas Jefferson), Mt. Vernon (the home of George Washington), Red Hill (the home of Patrick Henry), Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown because they gave me the sense that the place where I lived was critically important to the very beginnings of my country’s existence.

Sensory play soothes my kids - it helps to get out frustrations, gets out pent up energy, and makes a little body feel good. Playdough is an excellent sensory tool. So is sand, water, shaving cream, rice, pebbles, peanut butter! Let your child try out various textures, and don't be alarmed if they want to immerse their whole bodies into the substance! They're three. It's okay.
I’m going to present now a small list of things the Smartards have given us that serve no real purpose other than to shorten our stay in this universe.
There is one local runner that (I think) has the form, speed, and relative lightness to run barefoot on rocky trails fairly successfully...and that is "Barefoot" Josh Snellink. While I've seen him injure and bloody himself a time or two, he has a "realistic view" of what is possible with barefoot running (IMHO), and when it makes sense to wear shoes, to prevent injury or frostbite. For Josh to run absolutely barefoot on our local rocky trails, he needs to be obsessively observant of trail conditions, but he also needs to slow down on the downhills. This guy is no slouch...if he were wearing some type shoes and could run at his normal and (beautiful to watch) fluid pace - even on the descents, I think he would cruise to victory in quite a few races.
I hope all of you will visit their blogs and leave them so love.

I am not writing a speech, it’s going to be stream of consciousness just like the blog. Hope to see you.

How different, how unchanging. I will walk back soon to my Mom's apartment, wrapping my pashmina around my neck with each step, rearranging it while waiting at the light. I will most likely be the only person not driving as I was on the way here. I'll keep an eye out for the cardinal that lives in the tree outside her front door. Weeks from now, I'll remember the bell-ringing "all-righty"'s and "You have a nice day now" as I walk around the Roman Arena in silence, utter silence knowing one is not better than the next, just different and unchanging.
Finally, when she graduates and it is time for her to actually search for a job, she should 1) move to New York City (if she doesn’t already live here); 2) submit her resume as widely as possible to literary agencies; 3) give herself at least 6 months of searching (the biggest mistake candidates make is giving up after a few weeks or months); 4) not settle for a job which is not to her liking, or work for a boss who is unpleasant; and 5) apply for assistant jobs at book publishers if she cannot find one on the agency side. Working for a major book publisher is also great for the resume, and will help her land an eventual agency job. She should also remain open to the idea of working for the Subsidiary Rights departments of major publishers. This is something that few candidates consider, but which can end up being the most effective technique: it can be a much easier job to land, and literary agencies like to hire employees with Sub Rights experience, because many of the job duties overlap.

During the discussion one of the TAs mentioned the idea of "well, I wouldn't want to be that teacher, but..." which prompted me asking them that about all the teachers. After we had discussed a lot, I asked them to try and make a whole class concept map for instruction. Guided by the question, how can these radically different things we watched all fall under the category 'instruction' In particular, I asked them to think about criteria that we used to evaluate instruction, features that we use to describe instruction, beliefs and questions they have about it. This is what they assembled: (click for full size)

So, I’ve got an aching back, but I’m not sure if that’s from the exercises or just my ongoing back issue. Or both. I’ve also got some sore thighs. I know tomorrow is going to be even worse for those! But, I don’t mind the pain. I know it’s because I worked those muscles and they are letting me know. It does suck, however, when you are constantly following a toddler around the house and lifting him up. Thankfully, my little man likes to play independently and give me a break.
Anne Fortier grew up in Denmark and emigrated to the United States in 2002 to work in film. She co-produced the Emmy-winning documentary Fire and Ice: The Winter War of Finland and Russia and holds a Ph.D. in the History of Ideas from Aarhus University in Denmark. The story of Juliet was inspired by Anne Fortier’s mother, who always considered Verona her true home … until she discovered Siena.You can visit Anne Fortier’s website at http://www.julietbook.com/.

William moves into a cell with Senator James Moran, who went to jail for embezzlement. Moran says that while he's not innocent, somebody named "Harkins" is supposedly at fault for him landing in prison. Moran has smuggled yakydock into the cell, but warns William that he should find some money if ever he wants to obtain any rare goods while in prison. As part of his sentence, William is assigned the duty of shoveling coal in prison.
I'm in a grump today because I woke up to find it snowing again & as I write this it's still snowing, and to add insult to injury I did a full comedy fall on my way home from walking Logan, both feet lost contact with the floor as I went up in the air and then whumped back down, taking my weight on my arse and my hands, or more particularly on my right thumb, which is slowly turning a pretty shade of purple - should get me out of shovelling duties in the short term eh?

I grant a clemency for Perry, though I have no power, there are no grounds for clemency, and my clemency is of no consequence; Perry, in the matter of Cameron Todd Willingham, granted no clemency, though his power was extraordinary, the grounds substantial, and the consequences vital. His silence now will be far more chattered about than his silence then.
“I know what my introduction is,” Jenna reveals to DWM, “and I have a general idea of where we’re going to go. There’s definitely a story arc. It sounds really interesting, really exciting. I don’t think anything’s been done like it before, but there are lots of secrets and intrigue, and I think it’s going to throw and confuse a lot of people, and surprise a lot of people...”

I think it is especially interesting, from this Vengeful God who in later chapters will order a lot of killings in His name, that with the first recorded murder (and sin outside of eating the fruit), the punishment isn’t death. In fact, because Cain is afraid that others will kill him after they find out he is cursed, God offers him the protection that if someone kills Cain, they will be avenged seven-fold. Which effectively makes the punishment for killing Cain, a murderer, worse than killing your innocent brother because you are jealous his offerings are approved of by God.
When an Oregon college student, Mohamed Osman Mohamud, thought of using a car bomb to attack a festive Christmas-tree lighting ceremony in Portland, the F.B.I. provided a van loaded with six 55-gallon drums of “inert material,” harmless blasting caps, a detonator cord and a gallon of diesel fuel to make the van smell flammable. An undercover F.B.I. agent even did the driving, with Mr. Mohamud in the passenger seat. To trigger the bomb the student punched a number into a cellphone and got no boom, only a bust.
And I've met some wonderful booksellers who have organised excellent visits because they know their patch, they know their books and they know their schools. Booksellers like Elaine and Sue at SilverDell Books in Kirkham, who gave me a Rolls Royce (or Range Rover) of a day in and around Lancaster and even found time to show me their wonderful bookshop and let me sample their homemade ice-cream. Me, books and ice cream? It could get messy...
The maintenance of strong client relationships rightly remains a huge competitive weapon for law firms. The existence of secure personal bonds with leading clients has enabled small and medium sized firms to retain very significant clients who might normally be expected to use larger or better known firms. Again, however, I can identify at least three problem areas. The first is the obvious truth that although some friendships endure for a long time, many relationships tend to atrophy naturally over a period. Clients can outgrow firms, move away from the locality, or change jobs, and accordingly fresh relationships constantly need to be forged and new clients have to be sought. The second problem is that some client loyalties are to individual lawyers rather than the firm and can therefore be lost if the partner leaves, retires or dies. The third issue is that client loyalties seem to have become somewhat strained during the recession. One reason for this might be that whilst loyal and long-standing clients are not always as fee sensitive as new clients, nevertheless they may in some cases may feel that advantage has been taken of them, or that they have been taken for granted. Reliance therefore on the loyalty of an existing client base carries enormous risk as key clients may become impossible to replace.

I didn't like the sound of her voice either. It was coarse and thick with phlegm. I thought I could hear her smoking as we discussed the details of the trip. She sounded suspicious and a little angry, though I couldn't tell what for. By the time we hung up the phone, I was already hoping Margie was just a one-time passenger.

Q: Tell us about your biggest rock star moment, perhaps it's a moment of real success in your career, a time when you met someone super cool and had that Wayne's World "I'm not worthy" moment, or just a time where you felt like you got the rock star treatment. I get a huge variety of answers for the questions, so it's pretty much whatever "rock star moment" means to you!

So the diet. Hmm. I kind of took a break without meaning to. Last week's weigh-in I had gained .6lbs. Not a big deal. This week's weigh-in, I had lost a pound, so I'm down 15.4lbs from where I started. And I haven't really gotten back to it. I have a goal of losing another 15 pounds...or at least 10. But my heart isn't there right now. I did have to buy a new pair of pants for work last Saturday and when I put them on for work on Thursday, they were already too big. So I am still seeing results, just not on the scale. My plan is to start again tomorrow. I'd say right now, but it's just not realistic with plans to go out tonight.

Although most frequently associated with disease, our microbial hitchhikers help us much more than they harm us. How? By controlling many of the biological processes that are essential to our survival, including the maintenance of our skin and the digestion of our food. Each person’s digestive track alone harbors about three pounds of bacteria.
We see that in its slow-motion way, a tortoise actually rescues one of its kind… evaluates the situation, gets into position and pulls off a turnover.

After our coffee we set off for the headboard. Viv was a bit worried about how far we had to carry it, but we were only out twenty minutes in total and that included the time spent paying for it. We also had to wait for the man to carry it to the door; he was not going to allow us to carry it through his shop. We had plenty of rests at the road junctions, and had no trouble fitting it in the lift, so all in all a trouble free collection.
we did Christmas shopping
This is one of my favorite movies, I must admit it. I love everything about it. I think the story, the writing, and the special effects were really outstanding.

Somehow, I didn't inherit the competitive impulse at all. I've supported a WI Area competition a few times with jam and lemonade and so on (I was particularly pleased with 19/20 for my lemonade as it was the first time I'd ever made it) and the village competitions, making a scarecrow with Ro one year (we won with the Reverend Paul Pitt) but otherwise I'm not really interested. I enjoy judging though - as most of you know, I've been asked for several years to judge the home economics classes at Denton show and I take that on very conscientiously.
This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California labeling law can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels. According to USA Today:
(In a sidenote, my favorite part of the bank robbery is the manner in which it is introduced: an older gentleman with his face buried in a newspaper obliviously walks into the midst of a police blockade of the bank, looking up with a face that betrays mild surprise as he sees cops kneeling behind squad cars with guns drawn. Without saying a word, the man slightly picks up his pace and briskly walks away from the situation. It is by far the most energetic, emotionally charged part of the film.)
Kim Jong Moon, 56, a businessman in South Korea shared the same sentiment. “I know we were only supposed to observe Earth Hour by turning off non-essential lights and also unplug unnecessary electrical items, but my friends and I decided to go a little further by cutting our water and gas usage for the entire hour, you know, to make a bigger impact for our beloved planet.

Of course politicians on the left are attempting to take all the credit for the get. It is important to give President Obama high marks for making the call to send in the SEALs. It was a risky call, and if it had gone badly, he would have taken a lot of heat, especially since the Pakistan government wasn't informed of the operation. He took a big chance, and it paid off. But it is also important that credit should also be given to the CIA and George W. Bush for their interrogation techniques in secret prisons that got the initial information that started us down the path to bin Laden.

These are my go-to snacks to give my little boy, Jacob, now 23 months old. They are all reasonably healthy and he will usually eat them even when he is refusing everything else, including snacks I’ve tried making for him from scratch (yes, I have done that! At least once!).

Here's a funny thing. Part of the plot of The Faceless is based on the story of the Accrington Pals, who were wiped out on the first day of the Battle of the Somme: 1st July, 1916. As you can imagine, this and related subjects have been on my mind a lot over the course of the year as I pulled this monster together. But at last, so I thought, I could forget all about it.
I decided to use cloth wipes because I was irritated by how many disposables it took to clean my baby. It seemed like we were constantly buying them.

This all sounds like pretty woeful stuff. But there’s a flip side to this self-imposed torture. It’s this very self-doubt that makes you strive to make your work the best it can be (and in doing so, become the best writer you can be). It’s the thing that makes you edit your work to within an inch of its life; worry about the weak points in the plot, and go back and shore them up; to ensure that the characters are as rounded and believable as you can make them.
I have no idea why I still have the dress as it was not one that I had ever planned to pass down to my daughters...that I don't have and not like I am going to wear it again (if I do get married again, it will be outside, on a beach with a light dress...just saying) but it was fun to put it on last night and dance around the house for a little while. And the memories that it brought back were welcomed as well. I know my marriage did not work out, and the wedding might not have been what I had dreamed about, but it was an amazing weekend in Vegas with friends and family. I said that I wanted to gamble in my wedding dress...and that I did!

In case you wanted to ask, yes, we do often look like a bunch of weirdos. Sometimes it’s because our behaviours and little rituals (“second clap”, anyone?) can be impenetrable to an outsider, just like someone not familiar with martial arts might not appreciate the kata or the etiquette. Sometimes it’s because focus and coherence aren’t infinitely renewable resources – the more of it we use up, the less we have left at the end of the day. And sometimes it’s just our natural tendency, possibly exacerbated further by associating with like-minded people. That’s a whole different topic and I don’t want to get into it now, so I’ll just venture a guess that there are plenty of folks with mental illnesses out there who would be more than happy to trade it for just acting weird.

Or, you can have a farmhouse all on its own.

The characters are what makes this such an exceptional book because they are just so real. Cousins uses so many tiny details to bring the boys to life and they're definitely two of my favourite characters of this year. I was absolutely rooting for them from the outset, which make the book so much more enjoyable than if I'd only had lukewarm feelings for them. Caring about the characters raises the stakes and makes the outcome of the novel so much more important and I was really hoping things worked out as well as possible for Jay and Laurence.

When – 11-16 March, 10am-6pm
I've made a list of the anniversaries (the one I have goes up to the 60th - okay, maybe a little optinistic) but I have had to meld the traditional and the modern, as the traditional doesn't cover every single year.
I have spent several months now perusing a new body of literature, thinking deep thoughts with my right palm pressed against my sweaty forehead, wondering how I will get started, overcome by obstacles. Entire days have gone by when I haven't been able to identify a single productive element of the day, except maybe learning the definition of 'endogenous'. I have felt useless. I have felt lazy.
“And what about Lulu?” I asked, needing a quick fix of Lulu. It had been a while.
Right now, I wouldn’t want to be any other age.
I would have given anything to see the modern buildings again. Anything recognisable. The city beside the river lay degraded and twisted, ruined. It had been only a few years since my last visit but the world was so changed by the event and its aftermath that I may as well have been away for an aeon. Its trees were completely grey and brown, trunks hanging down into the river or across roads and dirt.
Everyone in the party except for Ahmet, Andrej and Frith will need to roll a d20 at the outset. At the moment, the fact that you're not fighting is keeping those dwarves who already feel terror from simply running off (though the book says the "sight of the dragon" is enough, I'm willing to stretch that to the dragon appearing confrontation - which this dragon isn't, right now).
Yes, I know this seems a little creepy, given one’s relative captivity while in the back seat of a moving vehicle driven by a stranger who knows you have money, and need him to get where you are going.
I am not kidding when I say this is my new favorite salad. I am pretty sure I had it the next day for lunch...and would have had it again for dinner if there were salad left.
One consequence of multiculturalism is that the white population, the people who can rightly claim this land as theirs, are now expected to act and to speak in ways that demonstrate their support and commitment to multiculturalism. In other words, whites, as victims of these ugly policies, policies espoused by Labour and which will be continued if the Conservative Party wins the general election, must show support for something which actively encourages their racial and cultural dispossession. If they cannot bring themselves to state the vile lie – “diversity is our strength” – they must at the very least eschew any public criticism of the ethnic cleansing of whites, especially if they work in the Macphersonised public sector.

If the technical aspects of the film are straight out of the top drawer, then the same can also be said for the acting. Burt Lancaster kicked off his career with some finely judged playing as the doomed Swede in The Killers, and Siodmak got him to tap into that same vibe to coax another wonderfully nuanced and sensitive performance from him. Once again he hits all the right notes as the big palooka whose dark romanticism sees him suckered by the machinations of a conniving woman. Every emotional state the script calls on him to display is carried off convincingly, from fear and disenchantment right through to the calm acceptance of his fate at the end – from the dumbfounded look of a guy who’s just had his guts kicked out by the woman he loves to the cloying sense of panic of a man under sentence of death and trapped in an anonymous hospital ward. Yvonne De Carlo didn’t have to go through quite as many stages, yet she’s still excellent alternating between the sassy, sensual broad that forms her public persona and the nervy, desperate woman she becomes in private. When she drops all pretense in the climax and reveals her true character to Steve and the audience there’s a tangible shock to be felt. Dan Duryea was an old hand at taking on the role of the slimy villain, and to that he adds a layer of menace as Slim Dundee. He manages this so well that it’s easy to understand the level of fear and trepidation he provokes in Steve when he contemplates the consequences of crossing him. While these three actors carry the movie, there’s real depth in the supporting cast too. Stephen McNally is solid and sympathetic as the cop whose friendship for Steve leads him to inadvertently push him into crime. In fact, there are lovely little cameos all through the movie: Percy Helton’s chipmunk featured barman, Joan Miller’s garrulous barfly, Griff Barnett’s kindly and lonely father figure.
He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘It makes people so incredibly angry when you are getting up early in the morning, working really hard to try and do the right thing for your family and for your community, you are paying your taxes and then you see people literally in a different galaxy who are paying extraordinarily low rates of tax.’

However, while free thought can often lead to contrarian ideas, it can also lead to great ideas and magnificent accomplishments, the sort of which we are used to seeing come out of these United States. Dr. Wendler is indeed correct in saying that the encouragement of free thought is by nature one of the essential roles of higher education. I cannot help but think that by questioning the importance of higher education, we place the long term prospects of our nation at peril.

The primroses I transplanted from the lawn to other gardens returned and are doing well. I also gave some to friends — one of the joys of gardening that I’m sure many reading this share.
While all true, Cloud delivery has three distinct characteristics which help to identify and to define itself:
Lake Tahoe is my happy place, it is one place were I can truly relax & soak in the beauty around me. And, I read ALL 3 Hunger Games Books while I was gone. SO good!!! I couldn't put them down. Can't wait to see the movie!
“Because,” Mr. Think said, “I was up at the stream this morning and I saw him there. His eyes were bright with malice. I know a look of territorial rivalry when I see one. I worry that we’d wake up one day to see our water system sabotaged. This guy, seems to me, is capable of anything…”, he paused for a moment. Nibras winced at the reminder of how evil Sharshar could get. He was also impressed that Mr. Think had figure that out already.
Although Coke tackled consumer behavior issues by the book; ranging from advertisements emphasizing family relations, to continuous market promotions, to mega-marketing, to an awe-inspiring distribution and physical access network; it has failed to gain more than a 22% market share.
I grew up with my Scottish Grandmother living in the house with us. She was in charge of feeding the birds and making the coffee. She did an impeccable job with both. Grandma Ann would perk the darkest, richest, hottest coffee you could imagine in a Corningware stovetop percolator. Since as early as I can remember, (3 maybe?) I used to sit with her and dunk "frycakes" (aka plain doughnuts) in coffee. For me, my morning espresso is much more than a jolt of caffeine. It is about nostalgia, a ritual and the comforts of home.
4) Back to the mess in Madison. Gov. Walker wants you to believe that taxpayers are on the hook for state employee pension plans. A blatant lie as the employees contribute 100% to this fund from their own wages. The media hasn't covered this aspect so it's no wonder some people are up in arms over this issue. Quite frankly, the unions have agreed to all wage and benefit cuts proposed by the Governor. What they don't want to lose is collective bargaining rights. Walker refuses to compromise as his ultimate goal is to bust unions to please big business interests and corporations. The pension facts are covered nicely here. And here.

A good attitude, even when you get discouraged or things get difficult, is huge. Optimistic views can drive a person to do things never before believed or seen. Keep hustling, and telling yourself the ‘right career’ will come along at the right time. (The right time isn’t always what you feel it should be.) Don’t act like you know everything. Be teachable. Listen more than you speak when contacting an employer or interviewing. No one wants to hire a know-it-all or a critical spirit.
I've never really done any good pranks because the day rather sneaks up on me and I forget to elaborately plan things. I save my crazy pranks for other days when people don't have their guard up.

Another good attack led to a free kick on the edge of Everton’s area. Up stepped rVp to take the free kick. rVp’s last goal from a free kick came on the 7th of October, 2007. That was in the 3-2 win over Sunderland.
“Smoking causes higher healthcare costs for everyone” only if you foolishly believe that more than 50 million smokers pay no taxes at all, let alone pay twice! Smoking doesn’t “cause” higher costs, but is simply a politically correct reason to charge higher costs to people that refuse to conform to the majority’s ideal of what enjoying life and living well is all about. Life is full of risks and people that smoke embrace it, while Anti-Tobacco proponents live in fear of statistically insignificant goblins.

The SAZ-2500D replaces the SAZ-2000D in our line-up. It packs 25% more power into a casing only 3/4″ longer than the older SAZ-2000D model. The 2500D features an output section equal to our highly regarded SAZ-3000D model and an extremely robust power supply section to back it up!
But alas, the belt means nothing when it isn’t the focus. I’m going to harp on Daniel Bryan because with his title reign and his subsequent battle to reclaim it, the belt is the focus. When he first one the belt, he was elated. Slowly it began to turn his persona more and more evil, as he was constantly trying to keep the belt and you KNEW he was trying to keep the belt. Him screaming “YES!” was a testament to this desire and still is. He kissed the belt versus getting kissed by AJ, another small fact (I notice the small things). When he lost it, he dropped the girl (who suddenly got very VERY attractive) and began his reign as the new anti-hero: Yes! Man*. Yes! Man flies through the ring with his index fingers high and demolishes his opponents with his powerful attack renamed from martial arts: the Yes! Lock*. And with this powerful lock and tremendous determination he climbs the lonely mountain to reach the object of his desire, his precious World Heavyweight Championship*!

After having spent most of my pay packet at yesterday’s Reiss sample sale, it was a deliberation as to whether I could justify another spending splash! However, when the opportunity to go to the Monica Vinader sample sale occurred I grabbed it with both hands! This is a brand which people may or may not have heard of – but their exquisite pieces imply a statement of individuality.

Almost as good is Shiner's Kolsch. It's not a Pilsner — Kolsch is a German style that the website says was created as an alternative to Pilsner. It's also a real pick-me-up when you're dripping with sweat. Highly recommended when you've fired up the grill, or just finished mowing. (Or both, as was the case with me today.) Dammit, I was about to go to bed, but thinking about it is making me want another one. And speaking of rapidly expanding portfolios, has anybody noticed how Shiner has just taken off? And how all their new experiments just put Shiner Bock to shame?

I stayed in Belgium for nearly two months that time. With Evelyne's amazing circle of friends, who became my friends, we went ice-skating, we drank gluhwein at Christmas markets, we drove to France for Christmas Day, we spent New Years sitting up all night eating a 9 course dinner and exchanging gifts, we stayed in holiday chalets in the mountainous Belgian countryside (the Ardennes) and we celebrated my birthday with a party that remains my best ever birthday. All through this, Hans was there. Sometimes with his girlfriend, but most often not. It was horrible. We were in love. I knew it. He knew it. He wanted to be with me. You could see the blue sparks of electricity between us. If our eyes met, my heart skipped a beat. All that cliched mushy stuff. But we did nothing. An accidental brush of the hand. A drunken sitting on the couch with my legs over the top of his lap. That was all. And a staring contest, in the sauna. Eye to eye. No touching. Truly. He is THE most loyal and honourable and trustworthy man you could hope for. He couldn't break up with his girl because she was doing her Law exams, and he didn't want to screw that up for her. I just had to understand. Which I did. But it didn't make things any easier.

On my second trip to Cuba I decided to distribute them ourselves for fear of their being resold. Years later we managed to take our organization to other countries and we intend to continue our expansion.
But I want to find it. Desperately. So I'm going to start trying. I'm going to start doing things wholeheartedly for me. Like actually taking the minute and asking myself, Where do you want to go to dinner tonight? or What do you actually want to wear? I think those moments can transform into larger choices and decisions. Or at least I hope they will.
Last week as we were driving in the van, out of the blue, Aaron said, "When I grow up, I am going to find the cure for cancer."
I’ve heard people say that “you have to take care of yourself before you can take care of someone else”. That may be true to some degree, but what if when we were feeling down or crappy or in need of “me time” we refocused and did something for our spouse? What if our efforts to take care of them first was reciprocated and they, in turn, did something for us? How awesome would it be if “me time” turned into “we time” and we could do things for each other, together? I admit I am totally guilty of putting myself first far too often, but I think I’ll try harder to purposefully do something for Dave first and then see what happens. Care to join me?

So Sunday night I made a Roast Chicken, which was delicious! And, as there usually is, there were a ton of leftovers. 2 people can only eat so much of an entire bird at one meal. After the initial dinner, I am always stuck with the question of what to do with all the leftover meat. In the summer time salads or even tacos are the easy answer, but in the fall & winter, a casserole is hard to beat. And the king of casseroles, at least in our house is chicken pot pie.
Then God helped me give in and the entire moving process started. The exhaustion of that process was not related to finding a place to live. Brad looked at our two options and we bought one before I stepped through the door. Unfortunately, I didn’t get out of actually packing and unpacking. If you’ve ever moved, I’m sure you completely understand how the physical process of moving is exhausting. It was so exhausting I still have boxes sitting in my room and still have no unpacking oomph left inside of me that wants to find places for the things inside them.
Like any other drug, your body will developed a resistance to the effects of the caffeine, and quite quickly too. I am not sure anymore if coffee actually gives me a high or if when I wake up in the morning I am somewhat ‘hungover’ from the last days coffee and the coffee I have during the day is just making me feel sober again (kind of like that theory that the best thing to do if you are hungover from alcohol is to have another drink).

Since lace is so easy to dye, why not color a few lengths of the trim pieces and create flower pins by rolling up the trim and stitching together the ends and then fanning out the 'petals'. These are always so popular to attach to jackets, purses, etc.
You may see it differently, but this was my take, and what I found most interesting -- and sad -- about this film.
Seriously, who wants to go to bed with nasal obstructions? Not me. I don’t know when or why this became part of my night time ritual, but just as I can’t go in to the cinema without going to the loo first, I have to clear my airways before getting in to bed. Please can someone tell me that they do this as well? Anyone? No?…

Under the agreement between the Zinnikers and NbN, dairy cows owned by NbN as an LLC were boarded at the Zinniker Farm. The cows were owned by the LLC rather than by the Zinnikers, who simply executed a services contract to board, care for, and milk the cows for their owners.
I'm wondering if this crush of hers might have anything to do with her not caring if I cark it, quite frankly. The first time she specifically asked about him, she was quite surprised to hear that he was my second husband, and that the Nestling Sparrow was a planned baby. The expression on her face said "How did someone like you manage to catch someone like him?!" Really, it was most unflattering to yours truly.

Eric Bana is Mark "Chopper" Read, real-life convict and bestselling author of "How to Shoot Friends and Influence People." His story is frightening, savagely funny and twisted. The son of a devoutly religious mother and a one-time soldier with a fondness for sleeping alongside a loaded gun, Chopper dreams of making a name for himself as a legendary crime figure. His journey starts out as a wisecracking criminal failure, inside a maximum-security prison, but he manages to twist his life into a fascinating and wickedly funny take that the press and the public can't get enough of.

Or more specifically, a meadow tucked behind the herodium; a rocky outcrop swarming with the late afternoon crowds. I followed a Greek family loaded up with their Easter Sunday picnic to the gap in the fence, and left the garbage-strewn cliff for a sweet piece of solitude.
On the other hand, the liberal-minded white (usually the women) can get rather hot under the collar with their fellow-whites the moment you suggest that birds of different feathers should not flock together, and that solid brick walls (and locked gates) beween neighbours of different colour and culture are sometimes needed to keep the peace.
Draw a line right in the middle of the longest side of the triangle. And that’s where your point is going to form. To do this, take one corner, and roll it in on itself, so that the corner lines up at the point of the triangle. Wrap the other side around to the back, and you’ll see that the two sides will line up right down the middle.

Quite a bit. I delved back into parapsychology and Cold War research, werewolf lore and legend and the primitive psychological fears humanity still harbors when faced with something different and wolfish. And science. Good heavens, there was some heavy science. Much of this shows up more distinctly in book two of the series, though, since I didn’t want to drown readers in detail—it doesn’t fit with the narrator’s personality.

And now finally we see the protest on Wall Street and in many other cities around the country attended by many of our young people. This new generation is showing us the way.

Although I might have wanted her to get revenge on the (nameless, faceless) people who bullied her (great revenge novels like Sidney Sheldon's OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT and Judith Krantz' SCRUPLES should be on your shelf) it's much less likely I'll sympathize with her now wanting "fame and fortune." Protagonists don't have to be nice or sweet or even good people. But they must get and keep our sympathy. Lose that, and you lose your reader.
Le Guin’s prose and research feel effortless; there are some hauntingly beautiful lines in here, such as “I felt that night that to have known such fulfillment was to be, in some part of my being, forever safe from absolute despair, from the ruin of the soul. Joy my shield” (214). She mentions in the afterword the reconstruction she had to do (and had to get help with) in order to get a handle on the geography of Lavinia’s world, and it’s quite extensive. She knows it well and she uses it without ever succumbing to Worldbuilder’s Disease, which I truly appreciate. But the structure of the piece strikes me as a little off-kilter. The majority of the novel deals with Lavinia changing, in whatever way she can, her own marital destiny for Aeneas, whom she’s chosen. (Well… more on that in a bit.) But once the two settle down, the novel briskly trots through the rest of her life, glossing over battles and wars when it can. While I appreciate the inversion of a text that I gather is quite focused on the battles and the wars, it just seems to trail off, especially given Lavinia’s awareness of her own fictionality.
On Thursday, after dropping off kids to school, I and my husband had an appointment with a Banker. She was explaining us all the new policies, terms n conditions which we both were patiently listening as she thought we were, but I admit we were not. We didn't knew this would talk 2 hrs. I don't blame her, she was doing her job n we were doing ours. And we didn't wanted to interrupt her either. So all this time went by n we were at our next level for paperwork. It was time to pick my little one from school. My husband had to leave n I had to be there for further proceedings. Finally, everything came to an end. All processed, Done, Deal, Signed....and my hubby didn't come yet. As I was waiting for him n wishing if I've had the book to kill my time, This banker came up to me n gave me this book to my surprise. What more could I ask for. The book is about financial security, money saving, investments and all money related issues. Though this subject is not my cup of tea, I started reading to kill my time.
There are so many examples - small and large - of things working out the way they needed to, of things that didn't go the way I wanted them to, but it was all for the best (at trite as that sounds.)

The number rods can be paired with their corresponding wooden cards. An important step is to scatter the objects that are to be match. This means that the numbers rods would be laid out randomly on the rug rather than in an order that may allow the child to simply predict the next number. Scattering the rods requires the child to count each of the blue and red spaces to find the correct quantity and length to match its card.

Then suddenly they will see what they have rejected and fought against and there will be great weeping and gnashing. Yet even now it is not too late to turn. The Lord cries out, behold He stands at the door and knocks. He will yet be found by those who seek Him in the day-time, but the darkness approaches. Seek Him now while it is yet light, for he who inhabits the darkness approaches with great fury and will destroy without mercy……. bro Frank
During 1933 Wandrei lived in a studio apartment in New York that was within easy walking distance of the offices of Street & Smith, who published Astounding Stories, so that Wandrei could easily bring in a new story by hand. His story “Colossus” was the first “thought variant” story (stories based on some new or not-yet-overworked idea such as other dimensions or the timetravel paradox), and helped revive the fortunes of Astounding under the editorship of his editorial mentor, F. Orlin Tremaine.

The only character I didn’t get was Black Widow, there just didn’t seem to be anything super about her, and that has nothing to do with me wishing I looked like Scarlett Johansson. The only thing she really had going for her was that she was a spy, and that she was one hell of a fighter. James Bond is good at shooting a gun aswell, but no one has ever called him a super hero. I’m just saying. And it annoyed me how she was fighting the bad guys with a bloody hand gun. Thor has his hammer, Captain America has his shield, Hawkeye has his bow and so on. She has a hand gun! With probably no more than 12 bullets, so what is she gonna do when it runs out? Never mind, I keep forgetting it’s a movie; of course she never runs out.

Nor could he have blamed it on Congress, since it would have been entirely implemented through the EPA's regulatory apparatus and executive order.

This could have the effect of making a different kind of distinction between speech and writing, however, as I’ve also noted that extraverts’ “talk” is often more like a kind of etch-a-sketch type of activity–it isn’t necessarily seen as the final/contemplated draft of ideas that introverts are more likely to perceive it as.

In the meantime, the roast is (hopefully) thawed, the stockings are ready to be stuffed, the presents are wrapped, the significant portions of the house are reasonably cleaned, and following my KISS program of holiday coping I have a box of crackers, a sliced brie log, and a jar of spicy tomato jam from my pantry for the potluck tonight, so I am relaxing with a cup of chai (maybe I'll have two!), and reading some mags the rest of the afternoon.

Motherhood thus becomes a holy calling, a sacred dedication for carrying out the Lord’s plans, a consecration of devotion to the uprearing and fostering, the nurturing in body, mind, and spirit, of those who kept their first estate and who come to this earth for their second estate “to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.” (Abraham 3:25.) To lead them to keep their second estate is the work of motherhood, and “they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.” (op. cit.)

If you can manage it, allow the cake to cool slightly before serving. I dug in right away and have the burned roof of my mouth to prove it. Totally worth it though.
In arriving at that conclusion, the SIU interviewed a civilian witness and eight officer witnesses, as well as reviewing a video of the arrest that was posted on YouTube.
What this means is that watching and recording sales is important, at least for the first week or so after the book is back in the paid store after going free. Authors who don't fuss and fret and obsess about watching the KDP dashboard are doing themselves a disservice. Authors who proudly admit they only check the KDP dashboard once a month, once a week or even once every couple of days aren't able to capitalize and optimize in an industry that now moves at digital speed. Why do you think Amazon updates rank every hour rather than just recalculating every 24 hours? Because when books are selling, it's a volatile business. Sometimes you can't do anything with collected data. Sometimes you can. In the case of our repricing strategy, we can.
For about sixteen years, Christ travelled through Turkey, Persia, Western Europe and possibly England. He finally arrived with Mary to a place near Kashmir, where she died. After many years in Kashmir, teaching to an appreciative population, who venerated him as a great prophet, reformer and saint, he died and was buried in a tomb in Kashmir itself.
In 1930, a $1,000,000 limestone Art Deco/Art Moderne courthouse was constructed between Guadalupe, San Antonio, Tenth, and Eleventh Streets. Precinct offices were assigned to the ground floor, county offices and courts occupied floors two and three, district offices and courts took over floors four and five, while floors six and seven housed the jail. Many additions and extensions have been made to this Courthouse, starting in the 1950s, so that now the 1930 structure is only a part of a large complex of buildings.
Police in Tel Aviv immediately began to arrest and round up organisers of an impromptu demonstration. It is noticeable that it wasn’t even Arabs they were arresting but photographers from the mainstream Israeli press and ‘trouble-makers’ of the Israeli left.
When I did that last photo shoot of Khloe (see previous post) she was very much in a posing mood, as I had mentioned. But what I failed to show you were the poses when I turned her 'loose' to pose however she wanted. And boy was she hamming it up for the camera! She even asked to make a "movie" so you are in for a treat! LOL!!

I was hoping to see how the diet would change my body, and I honestly believe that eating real food only changes your body in such a way that you lose what you don't need, you can eat as much as you like, and still feel full.
Anyway, as I said, I started this post on Thursday (I has started the cards then btw), Friday busy all day; Saturday I didn't go to bed until about 4am as I got carried away working on the in-laws card, which involved playing with my Cricut Expression machine for the first time since I'd had it back in March!!! So, because I went to bed late, my sister arrived before I was up. We went to the My Craft Studio warehouse open day which is down the road from me - we met Nancy Watt, Stephanie and Diane Peternall there - it was funny because my sister was a bit 'star struck'! She had a chat with them and they were prepping for a show this Wednesday where they launch a brand-new CD (which I've already bought, being a platinum member of the MCS Club). Plus there was this most phenomenal product on sale which hasn't been on C&C yet - so just because I'm not sure whether it's a secret or not, I shall not mention the product but after they've launched it, i'm going to rave about it!!!! Needless to say, I bought it... So, that will be on at 9am on Wednesday so i'm going to watch that.
Cantor: oh yes Fluffy
When dawn breaks they ask me how I am; I say, "I'm fine...you?" Why do I say that? Why don't I say, "look into my eyes, how do you think I look? I feel like shit but I'll tell you I'm fine because it's easier." That way I don't need to talk about my fear. Sometimes, when The Farmer holds me, I feel frightened to let him go just in case I never get the chance to hold him again. I want to stop missing my dad every fucking day and I want to stop crying when I look into his eyes. My Farmer may one day not be here either and that scares the hell outta me. But I'm fine. Just like everything else, I'll get over it and move on. One day I'll look down on my life and see only the good bits - the bad bits will be yesterday's fish and chip paper. I'll hold onto those memories, the good ones, and I'll say, "look at me, I'm fine." And I will be.
Artificial weather modification through the use of chemicals can impact us by reducing water supplies, causing dry snows, less rainfall, changing agricultural crop production cycles, reducing crop production, and water availability. Since most experimental weather modification programs use chemicals released into the atmosphere the public could be subjected increasingly toxic or unknown substances that could adversely impact agricultural crops and trees, not to mention our personal health. Global dimming and persistent contrails and chemtrails that produce man-made clouds, may have serious impacts on crop production, trees in our forests, and our trees on our private property, and Idaho’s Whitebark Pine. The dead and dying trees all around us are being attacked by beetles, and we have a tender box sitting waiting for the lighting strike to ignite and off she burns. I wonder at the governments answer all the time, well huh, its the beetles, and lack of moisture. Well did any of you brilliant government stooges do any soil testing for chemicals, like barium and or other chemical man made agents, gather some ring samples maybe, how about a water sample in these area’s, Never mind, I think I will get some samples myself for my own documentation, never needed you guys any way.

Beltain, the pagan fire holiday is due to take place tomorrow(and the next day). It is a holiday of beginnings, of putting seeds of mind and matter into the appropriate environment. It is a holiday preparing for hard work and growth and it the holiday to seal committed relationships in order to make them fertile and strong.

Your share will be calculated as the number of times that the Digital Book has been borrowed during the month as a percentage of the number of times all KDP Digital Books have been borrowed, multiplied by the fund amount we establish for that month...For example, if the fund for a particular month is $500,000, your Digital Book is borrowed 1,500 times, and all participating Digital Books are cumulatively borrowed 100,000 times, your Digital Book will earn $7,500 ($500,000 x 1,500/100,000 = $7,500). It sounds lucrative, but it should be remembered that this is only an example; KDP Select is too new for anyone to predict what the actual borrowing rates will be (according to Publishers Lunch, 129 titles are currently enrolled, from top KDP authors). Also, Amazon appears to have complete discretion in establishing the amount of the monthly fund, and in deciding on "the criteria for determining which borrowing events qualify for this calculation."

We may be shocked to realize that the essence of many of the powerful experiences we have are influenced in an immediate way by our great-great-grandparents and even further back in history. These include depression, relationship patterns, illnesses, divorces and even the age at which we die, as well as many “choices” we experience ourselves making, such as how many children we have, having an abortion or who we choose to be in relationship with. Only now, they are being lived out in a different circumstance and moment of history. For many people, it is easier to understand and believe the reality of karma when perceived in this tangible and practical way than through the vague notion of a soul moving from lifetime to lifetime.

My only complaint is that Veet promises each strip can be used multiple times until the sticky runs out. I found it ran out with the first go. Perhaps this was because I apparently really need to exfoliate my legs, or it could be the formulation.

On Tuesday I've released my second book, The Little Book of Anxiety, and since then I've been doing the round of interviews. Some of the questions I've been asked have been deeply perceptive and thought provoking, some have been fairly standard. But there are questions that none of the interviewers have asked, questions that beg to be spoken, questions that you, the readers, deserve to have answered.

“Although (Monday’s) events were unfortunate, we know that it was an isolated incident,” Clark said. “There is no residual danger.”
A good, general rule of thumb for any blog is to deliver the new material in the morning, so when your readers open their computers, either at work or at home, they can find your freshly published posts. Of course, this becomes tricky when your readers are located in different continents and therefore have different time zones. The optimal solution to this issue is setting different publishing times for your posts depending on the language they are written in. There is no doubt that this takes some effort, but it gives your blog a very professional allure. To help you managing several time zones you can use
The Sixth Doctor makes his début in an adventure that takes him from the desolate world of Titan III to the planet Jaconda which is in the slimy grip of the giant Gastropods. The Fact of Fiction places 1984’s The Twin Dilemma under the microscope, pokes it with a stick and uncovers its secrets!

Whereas in the first book Truth could only confront Jonathan with people who were alive at the time Truth can now raise the bar and put Jonathan through a whole other level of embarrassment and misery including meeting his battleaxe of a mother and being forced to attend a conference made up of versions of him from all the other alternate realities. All to a good end of course.

Saturday: We spent the morning at home, and then the afternoon watching our league soccer team thrash the opposition in the afternoon. I hate watching soccer but I love going because a) Nick loves watching his team play, b) the kids love it, too, and c) I get to read virtually uninterrupted for nearly 2 hours!!
My stupid social anxiety gets in the way, though. No one’s going to notice me if I stick to doing my job and don’t come out of my hole. But at the same time, I start panicking at the idea of getting out of my hole.

Interestingly, the "brain's right hemisphere plays an essential role in understanding and appreciating humor," psychologist Daniel Pink finds from studying neuroscience research. Incongruity often enters into humor. Not too surprisingly, the brain's logical left side does not deal with surprise and incongruity well, Pink adds.
The other thing I learned from all this much put off DIY business is that... I'm not very good at DIY. Check back in a few years to see what I do next.
What is perfectly clear is that there exists no "desperate need" for federal takeover of local law enforcement. Further, Holder said that about 7,500 hate crimes a year since 1990, averaging one every hour of the day, "is a staggering figure. . .completely unacceptable."
Thank you, Gina, for giving me the opportunity to play a small part in your story.
In other boat news, the yard where the boat is stored has been sold and we've been given 30-day notice to vacate. This morning, we talked to Vanessa, our broker, and she said the local gossip runs toward the new owners being developers who are trying to circumvent the state moratorium on converting boatyards into condos. Regardless, it seems like we have to find a new home for the ZP. Vanessa has a guy who is interested, so keep your fingers crossed that finding her new home will be somebody else's problem!

They said when they were done checking the house out, they would let us check out the truck, which was super nice – But they got another call, and had to go. So we got to see them drive away with their sirens on, but no fun times in the truck.
I just miss him so much. I'm having the empty arms... I wish I could do what we used to do. I would sit on his lap and he would wrap his arms around me. It was the safest place on the earth and he took that away from me.
This morning, however, for some strange reason, the class just fell apart. There was a sense of rhythm being lost: of neat and tidy dance co-ordination giving way to fluttery chaos.
I live by grace. And I walk by faith every single day. I’ve also discovered there is a strong, knowing, wise inner part of me some people get all spiritual about and identify as God’s voice or the Holy Spirit. That works for me, but calling it my gut works just as well. He put it there, after all. *
Firstly, those people who leave because the guild isn’t giving them what they want are not a loss to the guild as long as you are running the guild to the ideals you originally set out. We accept that maybe some of our raiders aren’t going to make us the top guild on the server. We accept that people in our guild might not cap their Valor Points every week because they have families, jobs and other real life issues to deal with. We would rather have fun in a raid than have miserable raids with highly skilled players who have bad attitudes. If you have players who don’t like that and want the guild to change, then its a good thing when they leave because all that does is make people miserable. The Officers get tired of listening to ‘the hardcore progression player who constantly moans’ because thats not the kind of player the guild is set up to embrace. If it was a hardcore guild, the Officers would equally get fed up with ‘the nice player who is a bit supbar’. And no guild likes ‘the jerk’, ‘the time waster’ or ‘the loot whore’. I like my guild and the people in it, but when those people who left are clearly looking for something the guild was never intended to provide, I can’t help but feel they are better off leaving because its the tensions in expectations that are the biggest problem most guilds face.
It made me realize that even though I do not get to see the stunning views on regular bases, the few times I get the privilege to see them makes the experience even more precious and enchanting.
There are times over the past year that I wished I'd never made the decision to have a family. That's a new one for me. I went into the endeavor thinking that if I did everything 'right' that things would, you know, turn out right. Which in retrospect was astonishingly naive of me. Had I been raising feeder mice perhaps that expectation might have proven closer to the mark; feeder mice don't cause a lot of drama and either way you end up feeding them to anacondas. During the course of this past year, there were people in my life that I would have liked to have fed to anacondas. I would be surrounded by obese anacondas right now. Obese, non-dramatic anacondas.

The first European to set foot on the Galápagos Islands was the fourth Bishop of Panama, the Dominican Fray Tomás de Berlanga. In order to settle a territorial dispute between the conquistadors Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, Berlanga sailed to Peru but strong winds blew his ship off course. He arrived at the islands on 10th March 10 1535 before continuing his journey.
The day of the terrorist attacks in New York, September 11 2001, I saw a version of my dream played out on every television channel. I couldn’t believe what was happening. My psychiatrist told me that all dreams represent something that has occurred in the previous 48 hours. Maybe, maybe not!

Preheat the oven to 375. Brush a sheet pan generously with some of the melted butter using a pastry brush. Lightly butter both sides of each slice of squash, again with the pastry brush, placing them on the sheet pan as you go. Sprinkle the tops with salt and pepper.
Say what you will about Lady Gaga, the girl can create moments. Leaps and bounds ahead of the rest of her 2011 album, this song was an instant classic the minute Haley Reinhart opened her mouth to sing it on Idol and Gaga followed with a performance of it the following week. Beautiful piano, screamtastic chorus, just… so incredible. Everyone needs to get off their hipster high horses and embrace the Gaga.

So, at the end of the day, do the people who buy this cereal think themselves worthy of it? Do they fashion themselves as the return of Jesus? Would they buy the Almond or Golden Flax flavor? And that price! $6.29! I can see that the makers of this cereal wish to make the consumers live amongst the poor.
Next time you go back to the supermarket, nothing has changed, so you go for the hamper deal again, and this continues for a few weeks. But then the supermarket starts raising the price of the hamper deal. It’s still a lot cheaper than buying the items individually — not surprisingly as the individual prices are ridiculous — but it is clear that prices are going up faster than inflation (or even than food prices in general).

It’s in the last graf of Janie’s article, though, that I found what I was interested in. It was bound up in a quote from ASU scholar (and former Corporation Commissioner) Kris Mayes. She said that the conference is a good opportunity for anyone interested in practicing in renewable energy law. “When solar energy takes off, this will become a significant practice area for a lot of attorneys in Arizona and other states in the Southwest,” she said.

I watched videos of my children. My son Noah being born, my older one meeting him for the first time, birthday parties, the first time they rolled over. They were all such precious memories and parts of the puzzle of my love for my children. Wipe them all away and the love is gone. Or is it? This is still the question. Is love strong enough to prevail?
For most 9 year olds, forgoing birthday gifts for donations to a food bank would result in a tantrum. For Noah, however, it was just the right thing to do.

On the positive side, there are cannulas inserted into the heart to provide suction during the procedure; it is also possible that once the vegetation came loose, the tricuspid weed got sucked up by a cannula. That would be best-case scenario. And bless our friend, Anne, who actually managed to make us laugh by saying, "It sounds like a bad student essay: 'The Machine Ate My Blood Clot!'"

That's right, Ryan and I both got a headcold this week and are still recovering. Emmaline, thank goodness (and thanks to breastfeeding) has not suffered at all but us parents are a different story. Ryan woke up Tuesday with a sore throat. We thought it was allergies but it got worse on Wednesday, the same day I woke up with a sore throat. Lovely. I won't go into the snotty details but it's been gross and we're both trying to stifle our coughs and sneezes so as not to wake up our lovely little baby all night!

From the other lane, coming towards us, we begin to see the cause of the hold-up. Marching towards us in crisp precision was a phalanx of police officers.

...A few days later after another unsuccessful attempt at fixing my hair I decided to go to the Hollywood place and check out the guy from California. I was worried about having an appointment or having to wait a long time; I guess that's why I don't have a regular stylist because I don't like to do those things.
Earlier in the day, designer Eina Ahluwalia’s accessory presentation looked forced and a pain in the neck for the models who wore them on the runway. Designer Payal Singhal’s offering also leaned more towards jarring than aesthetic when she attempted heavy ornamentation. However, designer Nupur Kanoi made a stylish presentation using long tapes of fabrics in a mesh format to treat the surfaces of her creations. Young Ruchika Sachdeva played well with silhouettes and surfaces. Designer Swapnil Shinde made another space-age presentation — something that he is known for by now.
I am assuming I will gain slightly this Friday, but I can't be sure - I have been trying to be really good about staying away from my scale (I have "cheated" a bit, but not nearly as bas as I was before). So, who knows, maybe I won't gain, maybe I will. In the big scheme of things, a gain this week won't ruin my whole effort. This is an on going thing. I will gain some weeks. I will lose some weeks. I just need to lose MORE than I gain. :) That's the theory, right? Haha

I've asked her teacher to let me know what apps Ashley uses at school so we can get the same ones for home. But, I am also interested in apps you may have found to be especially good for a child with special needs. Keep in mind that Ashley is severely visually impaired (blind in one eye, 20/2000 in the other) and severely hearing impaired (profound loss in one ear, severe in the other). She doesn't need any communication type apps, proloquo for example, because she indicated years ago that all she wants and needs for that are her hands for signing. She loves Tigger, SpongeBob and Elmo, and loves looking at people's (mostly children's) faces. She likes numbers and letters, and she likes movement, i.e. dancing letters and numbers. She's not a huge fan of coloring apps because she would rather create three dimensional artwork.

Dr Vivienne Nathanson, head of science and ethics for the British Medical Association, said: "We have to start de-normalising alcohol - it is not like other types of food and drink."I'll keep saying it - we're not talking of two issues here, there is only one. Those drinkers (and their associations) who were happy to let tobacco fall only hastened the onset of their own woes. Some of us did try to warn them, but there were just too many fingers in too many ears.
Taken as a comparison done on a features list, the distance between Android and iPhone doesn’t seem that far–and it seems that Android is ahead in some areas. And while that’s true, the experience of using a phone, a device that’s with you all day long, doesn’t boil down to what boxes get checked. The experience is driven by quality and attention to detail, how the device works and how you feel about it. There’s a reason people feel passionately enough about the iPhone to wait hours to get one on the day of a new model’s release. This happens sometimes with Android phones, but less often and at lesser scale.

Thinking and talking about coaching kids made me put into words my core attitude about coaching kids. If you follow this, you’ll do pretty well. I picture each kid riding to the game in their station wagon with mom/dad. I coach, so that I want each kid thinking, “…I can’t wait to get there. I really like playing X, it’s fun.”

In Compliance, a half-brother to the talented One Cool Cookie, began his career with the late Michael O’Brien for owner Sean Mulryan and made his debut in a bumper at Punchestown in April, 2004, finishing seventh. The following season he won a Fairyhouse bumper in November and a Punchestown maiden hurdle in January. In 2005/06, he was sent novice chasing and won his first two starts over the larger obstacles, before ending the season by being placed in Grade One contests at Fairyhouse and Punchestown. A Grade Three victory at Down Royal on his seasonal debut in 2006/07 preceded the biggest win of his career to date, when he got the better of 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War Of Attrition in the Grade One John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase in December, 2006. That season ended with a third place in the Grade One Punchestown Gold Cup in April. After finishing fourth in the Grade One Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase in December, 2007, he was not seen out again until November, 2009, when he won the Listed Thurles Chase over two miles and six furlongs on his first start for Dessie Hughes and new owners the Westerly Breeze Syndicate. He followed up his winning return by taking second behind Joncol in the Grade One John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase the following month but was generally disappointing for the rest of last season. He did run over the Grand National fences, taking sixth in the John Smith’s Topham Chase behind Always Waining in 2091. Last season he ran five times, putting up his best performance of the season when taking the Cashel Chase at Thurles on February 24 and he ended the campaign with a distant 13th in the John Smith’s Grand National. He has made two appearances this season, pulling up at Limerick in December and finishing third, between 37 lengths, behind Killyglen at Down Royal on March 17.

Khrys was still thinking about Sorlyna. As his horse sauntered on, he turned his gaze toward the river. Much of it was tranquil, hold for tiny little waves that rippled throughout in discordant patterns. As he was about to turn his head, he noticed one of the waves moved against the current. At that moment he realized that all of them did so. He shot he eyes to the other side of the bridge and saw the same little ripples moving around in the water.

My worst one so far is it is important that for the reader to see that Howie, a college freshman, knows what a bandelore is. He has to think it is natural for him to know about bandelores, Packard twin-sixes, and other things from the turn of the century, but so far my beta readers are missing that plot point and laughing at my dialog. So even being able to pinpoint where the problem is doesn't always lead to a solution.

Ernest Hemingway was once challenged to write a story in six words. The result: “For sale: baby shoes, never used.” Rumor has it that Hemingway regarded it as his greatest work. Stirred by this masterwork, the editors of BlackBook asked 25 of today’s most renowned writers to offer their own original six-word stories. Some offered more than 10 narratives in less than an hour’s time, while others took weeks to labor over each of their six words. In spite of its economy, the collection delivers the same humor, drama, irony, and suspense found in literature’s lengthier tomes.
A Must See
Syritta pipiens provides a good example of this. This is the most wasp-like fly I've found yet in my garden, though more extreme mimics exist. Glimpsed from behind as it moves quickly over the flowers, it could easily be mistaken for a tiny wasp.

After the film, I went to the vendor room and was disappointed to see that the vendors were packing up so early, but I was able to buy a couple of prints from Chris Kuchta - a beautiful print of his painting of Bub from Romero’s Day of the Dead, a print of Hellraiser’s cenobites for my friend Rickey, and this amazing print of this Night of the Living Dead painting which I then had signed by John Russo (producer), Russell Streiner (he plays Johnny in the original film), and George Kosana (who plays the Sheriff in the original.)
I intended to post this week’s “Truth Be Told Tuesday” yesterday but by the time I caught up on emails, Facebook and reading everyone else’s blogs, I ran out of time. So we’ll continue with “Truth Be Told Tuesday” next week.

A new division was also set up to produce and manufacture fabrics and wallcoverings under license to further utilise the Designers Guild sales and distribution network.
I have a new friend here who has been wonderful. She invited me to join with her and another friend for a weekly lunch date. We've gotten together with our families, we've gone to movies, plays, restaurants. She has gone out of her way to make me feel included. When we settle in our new home she will live a few blocks away. And I am so grateful for her.
But murders on farms, like murders in other places, take place from a variety of motives. To equate farm murders with “genocide” is simplistic.

"Chief among the creatures who gather around Diana is vampire Matthew Clairmont, a geneticist with a passion for Darwin. Together, Diana and Matthew embark on a journey to understand the manuscript’s secrets. But the relationship that develops between the ages-old vampire and the spellbound witch threatens to unravel the fragile peace that has long existed between creatures and humans—and will certainly transform Diana’s world as well."

Does that mean that the first book should not be published? Sadly, the answer is that these days it usually won’t be – because it won’t (defined by target sales) ‘work’ for the publisher. Yet authors (and editors) who have contact with youngsters in reading groups at school and library know that readers of book A exist: they’re borrowers not necessarily buyers – an impossible conundrum for publishers facing a library and school sector turning away from investment in books. Yet the readers are there and, if given access to forums or to authors, will discuss books enthusiastically and intelligently, reflecting their hunger for them.
Anyway, all this investigating and reporting including preparation and interviewing local residences (which I haven’t done before) made me feel like a real journalist. I was given a task, I prepared for the task, I went to an area where I have never been before, I started digging up information, interviewing people and try to find more information. Also, I had to cross-check the facts people gave me and see if the story is true or not, which also wasn’t very easy.
Still, in the light of what could or might happen, what was a forty minute detour to go via Swindon and buy some time?
I make a list of all the narrative drives to the story. I look at the drives for the external plot, the internal plot, and the subplots. At this stage, I write down as many necessary points to take each plot from beginning to end as I can think of. For a paranormal romance, these narratives drives could include: “Heroine discovers what she really is,” “The hero overcomes grief/guilt to find the freedom to reject science,” “Defeating the demon.”

In a 10-inch or 12-inch sauté pan, toast pecans in a 350 degrees F., oven (low fan) for 10 minutes. Coat pecans with honey. Once coated, place pan on medium heat and add butter. Lightly sauté pecans, season with salt and pepper, remove from heat. In a mixing bowl, place powdered sugar and hot pecans and stir until evenly coated. Place on a sheet pan and cool. With a knife, chop pecans into smaller pieces.

First the report on Labour backbencher Keith Davies uncovering some pretty ugly behaviour more associated with drunken yobs on a Friday night than that of an elected representative, making the slap on the wrist given out as punishment by the Assembly Committee even more farcical, it’s now left to the Labour Group to hand out any meaningful punishment, but i wouldn’t hold your breath. If Keith Davies had any decency he would stand down, in no other job would behaviour like that be acceptable.

My poor stepdad was still sitting across from me and asked who was that? I told him it was another of Rob’s ladies and my stepdad who never swore said “Are they assholes???”. It made me laugh hearing that from him, but I said yes obviously they both are and obviously neither of them has a brain combined between the two of them to be calling with such outrageous requests.
Here’s where you have to be firm, and continue the conversation. “No, really. If anything were ever to happen to me…” Gulp, deep breath. “If I ever get infected with the zombie virus, decapitate me. Shoot me in the head. Don’t hesitate. Save yourself and the children.”

So don't worry about buying new furniture. You can buy that when you're 45 and the kids are older and won't wreck it anyway. Don't worry about new cars. Don't worry about big TVs. Save some money. And teach your kids to save some money while they're young. Don't let them waste their 20s, even if they're not married yet. They need that time, and we're all going to have to learn to be a nation of savers, because the safety net is going to be awfully small by the time we need it.

Another specific problem with Borders right now - some publishers are afraid to send them books, in case they go out of business and can't pay for them. So even if a store like Borders - who has been awesome about supporting the Blood Coven series - wants to stock the books, they might not get to - unless they sort out their current financial situation. (Which I sooo hope they do!)
Last week, a friend told me a doctor she knows confided to her there is an unwritten rule-of-thumb (not mentioned to patients) that, unless something is obviously very seriously wrong, GPs only refer patients upwards to specialists if they come complaining three times about the same problem.
I don’t think I slept during that time. Normally I write my books in long hand and then type them, but if I remember correctly I was on a short deadline so I had to type the book directly into the program. Lucky for me, at the time I typed about 100wpm, and before I knew it I had written and edited the book. Looking back at it now I think I must have had fewer disturbances in my life.
It's all fascinating stuff. There were no ideas in this book which I didn't already know about but I loved reading about the evidence, research and experimentation which back them up. Some bits made me say wow, or laugh out loud. In mammals, there are two nerves running from the brain to the larynx. One goes straight there, the other goes down to the heart, loops around the aorta and back up again. In a giraffe, that's a bloody big detour. It's like that because of the way mammals have evolved from fish, and how each part of the body has evolved from some earlier organ. In sharks, the equivalent nerves don't have a detour. Oh you know what, I'm explaining this really badly - best to read the book yourself. But the point Dawkins is making with this chapter is that a so-called 'intelligent designer' would not have designed mammalian bodies like this. A designer would have gone back to the drawing board and routed the nerve sensibly. But evolution can't do that. It has to make do with tiny, step by step changes, and each change has to be an improvement on the last. So the nerve can't evolve a new route because the intermediate steps would be worse than before, not better. Once it finds itself looped around the aorta it just has to keep stretching as the giraffe's neck lengthens.
As the crowd slowly dwindled down, we decided to head back home. I think the bar we were at was staying open just for us because once we walked outside, they turned off all the lights and left, too! Outside we had a rock, paper, scissors battle for the change from the ticket. Ryoto, our Canadian friend Claudia’s boyfriend, ended up winning. I think that Claudia claimed the prize, though, since she had actually paid for his meal.

Alecina B. White, born in New York City, published a poetry collection called Little Folk Songs over 100 years ago. It included a short poem about squirrels which has been reprinted many times over the years, often without receiving proper author credit. Susan Luri, author and editor of R.L. Stine's best-selling Goosebumps series, wrote additional verses to White’s poem to create this charming story.

Mr. Rao told the Bench, which included Justices D.K. Jain, S.S. Nijjar, Ranjana Desai and J.S. Khehar, that the court, while framing the guidelines, might take into consideration the relevant norms of journalistic conduct laid down by the PCI. Explaining the powers of the PCI, counsel said: “Section 14(1) of the Press Council Act confers on the Council power to warn, admonish or censure the newspaper, news agency, the editor and the journalist or disapprove [of] the conduct of the editor or the journalist, as the case may be, after holding an enquiry into the complaints. The Council, which is presided over by a retired judge of this court and in which editors, working journalists and managements of big, medium and small newspapers are represented, has laid down Norms of Journalistic Conduct. Self-regulation is always better than statutory regulation. However, when any TV channel, newspaper or news agency fails to adhere to the guidelines laid down by this court, appropriate orders may be passed in the facts and circumstances of each case.”

Is life getting faster a phenomenon of aging or is life really getting faster?

Not all of my friends are my age. Some are considerably younger, yet I hear from everyone how fast it all seems to be going.

Oh, yeah – forgot to mention that. There’s an alien invasion in this one, as some extraterrestrial rude boys turn up, possibly to complain about scientists shooting giant lasers at their planet. Disrupting some rather convenient naval manouevers most of the characters are engaged in, they stick up a giant invisible space umbrella (…ella, ella, ella) over Hawaii to keep most of the fleet out and set about calling home for reinforcements (sadly for the purposes of this rather weak running gag, not an SOS). The task of stopping them is, needless to say, up to Hopper and his crew (which includes a Barbadian singer, none of whose song titles I could crowbar into this sentence).

Having some trouble with Avon today, they changed my district which was fine and changed my delivery day to Saturday which was okay. But guess what, my order didn't come on Saturday, instead they shipped it UPS and it arrived late this evening. That is going to make it harder for me to get the orders to my customers. I left a message with my new district manager so we'll see how good she is to work with and what options she comes up with for me. I'm surely not making enough money off this to put up with any aggravation !!

Maybe I can get the want to get some regular posting done because I sure don't have it right now. There is pretty much nothing interesting me in the card world right now. The 1971 set has come to a screeching halt. I'm buying zero new product (Gypsy Queen was a total letdown if you ask me) and pretty much won't be until Series 2 hits. No I don't care that Harper is in it but I also don't mind that Topps is doing it either. Harper can sure drive a product to sell and thats what Topps does, sell cards. Sell cards to make money. It's the simplest explanation that people seem to forget.

She spoke such amazing truth to me, not holding back! This is her passion and it showed. She basically was telling me that I cannot protect Ella. But God can! That I cannot guard her emotions but God can and will. That I cannot guarantee a baby staying with us, but God knows. That I cannot control my heart breaking many times through this process, but God has already supplied the grace needed.
I refuse to go along with this week's warm, feel-good celebrations of Harper Lee's novel (published fifty years ago today), To Kill a Mockingbird. Simply put, I think that novel is racist, and so is its undying popularity. It's also racist in a particularly insidious way, because the story and its characters instead seem to so many white people like the very model of good, heartwarming, white anti-racism.
We have in America an ADMINISTRATION controlled by the Congress, the government is the one of the people, Barack Obama did not respect this rule and played with the Senate and the House a kind of bad art of secret. The impeachment that we are promoting now, for a President of the Country who decides without judgment his own policy, will be a positive reply to his negative vision of the revolutions in progress in the Middle-East. He preferred to have a memory and feedback of his own experience in Africa that is not an Arabian one than to respect the sovereignty of this State of Libya, deserving respect and UN anger management military therapy program BUT NOT AN AIR FORCE STORM never authorized.

It makes me itchy all over just thinking about it. Obviously the sleep chairs are slept on by people from all sorts of living conditions and they are fabric. This has always been a grin and bear it situation---emphasis on bear it! I've always been a bit creeped out by the chairs and you would all probably laugh at my layering routine of blankets, sheets, Thermarest, and pillows before I sleep on them. I typically have at least 5 layers that amount to a few inches on top of the chair cushions. It's borderline "Princess and the Pea." The only problem is that I have no way to really cover/insulate the arms or exterior of the chair. One of the housecleaning ladies cleaning the room we were moved to said she was surprised they could be infested because they wipe them down with an antibacterial wipe. Obviously she's never really looked at the chair with the possibility of having to sleep on it. They are sometimes stained and food and candy wrappers are often stuffed in the cracks. I tried to kindly mention the fact that wipes don't kill the bugs that make their way through the fabric and into the cushions.
The quiet was deafening.

However . . . at my 41 week appointment, I had some questions for my OB. I have absolutely loved her, and I'm so glad a friend referred her to me! My OB is pretty conservative, medically speaking. She won't even induce first time Mom's unless there is a severe medical condition. So it was encouraging to hear her thoughts on inductions. She was happy to wait it out with me if I wanted to wait for labor to start on it's own. But, I asked her if the success rate of inductions is better in 2nd and 3rd labors. I wanted to avoid a c-section if at all possible. Her response was very encouraging as she said without a doubt, women who are already dilated and have already had babies have a very high success rate both statistically, and in her own experience. Since we were a week away from Thanksgiving, and I didn't want to have a newborn the week of Thanksgiving with family visiting, and I wanted to be sure my Mom could be here for the birth, I told my OB that if I was actually dilated, I would consider being induced the next day since she was on call then.

Had the authors of PPACA set up an “uninsured patient tax”, with anyone who buys qualifying insurance exempted from said tax, the lawsuit against PPACA would be dead in its tracks. Now, there might be states rights claims against the Medicaid expansion, and I suppose one could argue that the state exchanges infringe on states rights, as well. But those seem like huge leaps.

The cathedral hush of the ocean at daybreak is as compelling a part of my life as the inland dawns Brigid describes, and hundreds of sunrises are burned into my mind. From clear, hot skies with a purple sun breaking the horizon to cool, drizzly, sullen sunrises on an ocean fishing pier, where the sun isn't seen, certainly isn't felt, but just a brightening to the clouds. The ocean at night, even in sight of the bright lights of land, takes on a different feeling than during the day. The open ocean during the day is certainly a dangerous place, and you feel you're on the roof of an unseen world; but at night it takes on a different, almost ominous feeling. A fish breaking the surface chasing bait while you sit in utter blackness gives you a gut-level understanding of the ancient fears of sea monsters.

If all goes well, I may brew it again some point soon, but with a few slight changes such as using a wild yeast strain or adding more flavourings (ginger might be nice??), but lets see how its goes first. My next batch of home brew is looking like its going to be just a basic English bitter (oooooh yes, I really know how to make things exciting :P) but I'm gonna try a few variations on what hops and grains I use so it makes it a tad more special. Right...enough of me banging on. To the beer!!

We're at the end of a three-decade long incarceration "bubble" that dwarfs that witnessed by any other society in history. Perhaps, just as folks are rethinking their reliance on free-market ideology for analyzing the economy, the criminal justice system should be rethinking its reliance on this primitive, flawed metaphor based on the same principles. After all, it's taxpayers paying the price, which it turns out is not the same thing as enduring the punishment.

A South Indian clerk called Tirumal Appa had become a good friend of Shankar’s. They were of similar age. Tirumal spoke English rather well. He was keen to explore new things. He left home for Africa to explore new lands. That evening Tirumal came to sit next to Shankar. He talked about his family, his younger sister, whom he was really fond of. She was the one he missed most. Now this sister was going to be married off towards the end of September. Do you reckon the engineer sahib will grant some leaves? He asked Shankar.

CBA has followed Spain's Estrella Damm through door number two--removing gluten from barley and brewing it normally. No millet, no sorghum, just regular ingredients processed by removing the gluten. (CBA has lots of information and science behind the testing standards.) I'd love to know the process--I envision hundreds of lab technicians dissecting malt grains and tweezing gluten molecules, but as delightful as that image is, it's impractical and unlikely--but Widmer's not saying. There's other science here I'd like to know more about, like how the two beers, a pale ale and a lager, manage to raise a head without the gluten. Perhaps in time these secrets will emerge.

6. Tell us how long have you been blogging. I started blogging about a year and a half ago. It just started out as a hobby once in awhile, but soon I was playing along with some card challenges and it grew into an addiction! I started blogging the same time I started stamping and feel so blessed to have made such wonderful friendships with so many people in blogland!
Yesterday was my birthday, and I was so glad that I had the opportunity to ride, though as you can see from Joey's windswept mane, it was VERY breezy outside! I'm supposed to work on keeping him long and low with leg, leg, leg and building his back muscle when I ride, and my personal goal has been to not fling my upper body about at the canter with him. I can always feel it the next day in my abs and calves, so I feel like I am making some progress...he really is a good boy despite trying to convince me otherwise once.
I love the Milwaukee River. I want to see this river come back to life, year after year regaining health. I want to see no more poison seeping into the river, no more dams suffocating it, no more destruction of any kind. I want to see all of that destruction reversed and those who would commit abuse stopped and held accountable for their crimes against life.
Various sources indicate that the Chinese side thinks in terms of a long-term zero-sum game, and this requires that America prepare to defend its interests against potential Chinese efforts to undermine them as China grows stronger. PLA aspirations for dominance in the near seas (jinhai) potentially challenge American freedom of access and action in international waters where such freedom is deemed vital to meet American commitments to friends and allies. The context for this is that, as China’s strength in Asia grows, it is more important for America to maintain the credibility of its commitments to friends and allies in the region.

However, it’s usually only once a book has been published and has picked up some momentum--good sales, excellent reviews, media interest--that it becomes a viable candidate for foreign sales. Your agent, therefore, will concentrate on selling your book for first-time publication before he starts thinking about foreign and/or other subrights--and since he’ll be doing that in his own country, your book needs to be a good fit for that market. Books with American characters in American settings usually aren't suitable for first sale in the UK, just as books with British characters in British settings usually aren't suitable for first sale in the US. It's tough enough for any book to find a readership; it's even tougher when the subject matter may not resonate with with the prospective audience. That's certainly how publishers see it.
At bedtime, we read together, and then it was time for lights out. We said our goodnights, and I went to my room to read.

MOONLIGHT YOUNG PALE ALE is an orange-tinged, very hoppy pale ale. It’s spicy as all get out. You ever tried THREE FLOYDS ALPHA KING before? It’s that kind of pale ale – the one that’s really a strong, intense India Pale ale hiding behind the “American pale ale” category. Malts were interacting with spices interacting with big-ass hops – wow.

Once when meeting with a parent about their child’s behavior, the father sat up and loudly said, “We’ve done every thing we know to do. We’ve taken things away from her. We’ve spanked her. Why we even grounded her and the groundation didn’t work.”

Once they were out of the oven I then did some Yorkshire pudding. The best method for a successful YP is equal quantities of eggs, flour and milk (in this case 3 eggs ratio) and a very hot oven and a preheated tray with a high burning temperature oil in each section. These can be made well in advance and simply reheated again under a grill (watch they don’t burn)
“She ran The Downhill Trading Company, which had jewelry and clothes and crafts of all kinds. It really made the town quite famous at the time and it got written up in one of the newspapers. Then she helped run Emilianos, the clothing shop that was owned Ava Guitterez.
Eventually I had to postpone our flights to SA by about 3 days because I really did not want to be weak and sickly while carrying luggage to the airport and sitting on an inter-continental flight for 8 hours. Funnily enough, those last 3 days were the most relaxing of the whole trip! My body thankfully recovered fast enough from the fever and we actually managed to catch a movie with the family and relax a bit towards the end. So although the whole trip now seems like a blur, it was totally worth it. Now that I’m back in my regular routine, daily grind… whatever you want to call it, I can finally relax.

I began Sunday afternoon and felt like I was slapping dough for hours on end. In order to bring this into work, I set the alarm for 2:30 am so I could pop it into the pan and let it go through the final rise. As I was padding through the dark house, I came to really appreciate bakers and the time they spend making bread! Went back to bed and woke up to a nicely risen dough! A quick pop in the oven and voila! Kugelhopf!

So it was cute. The house needed a new coat of paint. Probably would need a new roof within the next year or two, too. But that wasn’t his problem. He stood at the end of the walkway and watched the endless parade of parents driving up to the side of the house. The side door opened, parents dashed in to retrieve kids, then the car drove through to the back alley and the next car pulled up.
Seriously hate it with a passion! It’s such a pointless boring way to spend your life in my eyes. I mean don’t get me wrong, sometimes it is really nice to just have no other concerns other than your own feelings and emotions. It’s nice sometimes to be able to go out, drink as much as you want, flirt your ass off and not feel bad about it in the morning; but how often do I do that anyway? Like never.
Even though spending time with Him may cost me sleep, time with my kids, comfort or even popularity...I must choose to maintain this precious relationship between me and my Lord. I must choose, at times, to let everything else go and just sit in His Presence! Nothing compares, NOTHING!

The trio had barely made it to the camp proper before they were surrounded by a crowd of cheering people. The noise rousted the girl from her light slumber and her dirty little head swiveled on her neck, her eyes darting rapidly in search of her parents’ faces. Then, suddenly, they went wide and Rayloth looked to see the old man who had briefed them when they had arrived, his short white hair looking as if he had been pulling at it the entire time they’d been away. Next to him, pushing her way around him, was a short, plump lady with her graying hair pulled back into a tight bun. The plump woman elbowed her way through the crowd as if they were little more than swamp stalks and was reaching for her daughter just as the little girl was squirming herself out of Jerf’s grip. The two fell to the ground, the mother’s arms clinging tightly to the daughter as if she was determined to never let her go again. Both let loose a flood of tears he was sure had been on the verge of eruption for days.
I will say, the one thing that has always baffled me about these boys is, did they all know that the other was calling me? Was it an inside joke the three shared? Or was I this big secret that each one kept from the other? Oh well, I digress, back to the boys.
Then I started reading some fellow bloggers post. One talking about her daughter getting sick, another who wrote a tribute to an Ex that passed. (been there and done that twice so I know how she feels. RIP) And then, after that, all I wanted to do was yell at myself.

It’s simple, it’s shocking but most of all it’s fun. The humour inherent in the posters takes nothing away from the seriousness of the subject matter. In fact, I’d argue, by turning AIDS advertising on its head – ie: by no longer hammering people with the doom, gloom, grim-reaper messaging – and instead playing up the fun side of sex (because yes, from experience I can faithfully and happily report it can be fun) the message conveyed is all the more effective.

Mr Rose spoke at length about how he studies the way women hold their heads, walk, talk etc, and tries to emulate them. If he really was a woman, he wouldn't have to study feminine characteristics, as he would already have them. The fact that he can identify the distinguishing traits which differentiate men from women gives proof to the innate existence of theses differences. His own studies prove that he is a man. He may be a man who likes to play at dressing up, and more than likely gets sexual pleasure from his transvestism, but he is a man nonetheless.

As the game developed around the country schools got tired of playing against themselves and decided to expand their horizons and start playing against other schools with football teams in the region/area. The 1st ever game between two schools took place in the state of New Jersey on November 6th 1869 when Rutgers and Princeton Universities. The two schools located just 37. 1 miles away from each other developed a series and became rivals. The following year Columbia University joined the series which prompted Yale University and Stevens Institute of Technology to form a league or an early type of conference.

So obviously, again, Paul’s reference here is to worshippers drawn into the ever-present danger of idolatry, one danger of which is unbridled sexual licentiousness of the kind that a conservative Jew like Paul would have found abhorrent. Especially when seen against his mission to the Roman Empire, with its endless parade of cults and religions, and very lax sexual behaviour generally.
UPDATE: Jessops are now showing the price of the D4 at £5,289, Wex still at £4,799. The prices of the D800 (£2,399) and D800E (£2,689) remain unchanged at the time of posting. Amazon UK have the Nikon D800 at £2,399 but have not shown the Nikon D4 available for pre-order, unlike other dealers. Interestingly, Jersey-based Play.com has the D800 listed at just £2,099.99 - though it's not clear if that price includes VAT. They have a 'Pre-Order Price Promise', but it's based on the price dropping (so you pay the lower price), not on it increasing.

And so, as I continue to post here (and love doing it!), from time to time you may see me taking a bloggy break. And I will come back when the time is right, feeling refreshed and inspired by spending time doing what is truly inspiring to ME!!

Since Juliette has been little she has loved putting popsicle sticks into an empty container and then dumping it out. We keep the container filled with popsicle sticks in the cabinet where she can reach it and she takes it out to play with them often. One day, when Emily wanted to use the popsicle sticks with her and I didn’t have an extra empty container for her to use by herself I decided to turn this fun fine motor activity into a new math game that the girls could play together.

Tourism in Ladakh has increased remarkably in past few years, majorly because of development of good hotels in the region and better transport facility.

Long story involving an iPad... mine...but,
Aunt Ida kept splendid notes and when it came to recipes, she many times offered suggestions as if it was a work in progress, comparing one technique with another in seeing which worked out the best. In the meatball recipe below, she mentions 'while mixing the meats with the seasonings (and here I know she includes vegetables too) use a cold metal spoon, dipped in ice water and gently fold mixture together.' She forgos of using her hands as the temperature and pressure will pack down the meat and will make it tough after cooking. Only at the very last of shaping does she roll the meatballs into orbs using her hands and then the hands 'should be ice cold.' She also mentions in making the sauce a variation for a brown Creole sauce using a dark roux.
Those little mantras made me venture into baking with yeast without even me realising it. It was only after I started food blogging did I realise that many fear or feared yeast at one point in their lives. When people write to me about how I go ahead with recipes and come out with success, I tell them my mantra,'Do not fear the ingredients, they can sense it!' Atleast that's what I have been doing. If I see a recipe I want to try, I just try it. I never think about the what if's, but how's etc. Why waste your precious time pondering over such petty issues? ;-)
I thought I'd wear these toe socks. When you've got so little between your feet and the mean Brooklyn streets, every little bit of fiber counts. I'd heard you needed to start slow, so I decided to go for a mile. That's a short distance, right? So I went on a wonton soup run.

TODAY’S NEWS in the Intelligencer:‘Three nights last Lord Spittal was rob’d in his coach by the Infamous Gentleman Highwayman. The highwayman, having fired a pistol shot ‘in terrorem’, and Lord Spittal, declining to give up his belongings, instead offered up his daughter. The daughter willingly accepted her surrender and according to the coach drivers seemed most excited at the prospect. The Highwayman thence proceeded to rob Lord Spittal of his belongings none the less having declared “a Gentleman who gives up his daughter so readily, instead of his riches, deserves neither the title of Gentleman, nor the riches to keep him”. Thence departed with the the young lady much to her apparent delight.’ NOTE: Despite my repeated attempts to return daughter, she instead away to Paris, being much pleas’d at her escape. NOTE: Gave her the money I took from her father to aid her journey.

Meanwhile, as Jenny and company get stranded in their boat and are stuck on one side of the island, three hikers or backpackers or whatever they're supposed to be are ion the other side, also looking for the disappeared/dead scientists. Why? Don't ask. They find a cave, stupidly wander in and find an old dusty book that has printed on the cover in big bold letters "The Book of the Dead", even though they call it "The Book of Death". Why? Don't ask. Being idiots, they read from the book and cause the pajama zombies to appear again, and they are eaten except for the guy with them that has the most open shirt and sweaty, overly-chiseled abs. Guess he was too oily to hold on to. This guy, Chuck (Jeff Stryker), runs all the way across the island to catch up with the rest of the cast, and all the zombie catch up with them and then it turns into one of those fights where if one isn't shooting, the other is biting.
Another reason that more women than men were targeted for witchcraft was that the Elizabethan society was male dominated. Men were all powerful and women enjoyed few rights. They were expected to be subservient to men.

Back in September, I posted an entry wondering if the seeming ubiquity of preschool attendance for three-to-five year olds around our neighborhood made it an unavoidable necessity for my own children to go to preschool (The link is here). My biggest concern in that post was how my children would learn to interact socially with their peers if they were with me while everyone else was at preschool. In many respects I was not actually trying to answer this question in my post. My intent was more to highlight, and vent my frustration at, one of those moments in parenting when the choices others make significantly constrict or complicate my own range of options.

A CIVIL ACTION
To make a setting exciting you must discover its inherent conflict and then use that conflict in your story. Make it relevant. Make it live and breathe. Make it so vital that if the story were set anywhere else, then the plot would fail.
Will Self’s review highlights the claim that Hakim makes that sex work should not be demonised, and it would seem that Self is inclined to agree. However, Self does seem to feel a sense of mourning or acknowledge a loss of innocence from addressing the reality that ‘Erotic Capital’ portrays, through Hakim’s notion of female gender empowerment through sexual empowerment. QRG also addresses this as a form of a backward step in the journey towards equality. Self rightly points out how Hakim creates strange bedfellows of radical feminists and the religiously conservative, and how they have similar views on the public display of feminine sexuality.
Before I share my reasons, I want to first make it very clear that I have many good friends and acquaintances who have chosen to go this route. And I truly wish them all the best. I hope they become wildly successful and their books get a gazillion fans, because the more good books we have, the more readers are looking for good books to read. And that's fantastic news for every book lover and author out there. Yes, there will be some good Indie titles, some that could have used some more editing, some that make people who like the written word go all twitchy, and some that will blow traditional books away. It's called a bell curve and it's apparent in just about every group of anything in life (yes, I took statistics in college).

I’m kind of nervous about meeting his family though. What if they don’t like me? I’m sure they will. I’m a really interesting person. Wouldn’t it be funny if they couldn’t speak English? Then what would I do but my other friend said they DO speak English in Greece. They just spoke Greek before there was English, which makes sense. And anyways, it doesn’t matter because he speaks English. It says so on his page.
At this point, the 4:00 pace group was way out of sight and I started to get really upset. It only took a few seconds for the feeling to come back in my foot and when I started running again and realized that I was right on pace but I was still upset that they were so far ahead of me. By Mile 5, my foot had gone completely numb again and I just wanted to quit. I couldn't run like this for 20+ more miles and it was already hot and humid and I was letting everything get to me. I stopped to walk again to let the feeling come back in my foot and took the walking break to clear my head. I was right on pace for where I wanted to be and my legs felt great. If the 4:00 pace group wanted to be running 40 seconds faster than what was necessary for a 4:00 marathon, then they could go ahead. I was going to run my own race. And run my own race I did.
We planned entire days around one of Disney’s epic meals, with cart snacks and mini-meals placed strategically throughout the day to optimize the gluttony of the big feast. There was an art to creating such an event. Obviously, a wise planner would not go to Disney’s Rockin’ Roller Coaster, right after eating the full spread at Disney’s Ohana Luau Feast. A ride like that would be better paired with something light, like Disney’s churro and a Sprite, delicate to the palate, sugared for speed, and boasting a fruity bouquet.

At the station, the Enterprise is attacked by the Reliant at a point in which our two running themes converge. Khan is not satisfied with simply escaping from his exile and stealing Genesis, both of which make him an extremely dangerous man. He needs for Kirk to know he has had his revenge. Likewise, Kirk has gone in by the seat of his pants, recklessly getting his ship severely attacked and a number of his crew killed. Both men’s flaws have cost them dearly.
If I am caught in suffering, in pain, I create the idea of peace, the idea of tranquillity. I create the idea of truth according to my like and dislike, and therefore that idea cannot be true. Yet that is what we are constantly doing. When we contemplate as we generally do, we are merely trying to escape from confusion. “But”, you say, “when I am caught in confusion I cannot understand; I must escape from it in order to understand.” That is, you are trying to learn from suffering.

But if you want to have original names look to your wedding’s location or theme for ideas. You can also use the color of the drink for inspiration and you don’t have to have the word “cocktail” in the title.

The rest of you probably knew that already, but when I was grumbling about doing it in the first place and swearing at the lead that kept getting stuck around the end of the ironing board, it wasn't the most mind-freeing thing in the world.

Join us Sunday, April 1st, for our four year anniversary party. We will be hosting a complimentary buffet from 4 - 7pm. We will be tapping a selection of special, limited drafts along with some of our favorite beers. Look for a specially made oak-aged Stillwater Folklore on our hand pump, Malheur 10, Voodoo Love Child, Central Waters Peruvian Morning along side Spaten, Franziskaner and Ommegang drafts. We hope to see you there.

I have another thought this month, something a little more on the serious side.
more mommy time. for crafting, for cleaning, for exercising, for cooking, for mommy stuff..
I 'made' it myself from a whole load of colours of roughly DK weight yarn in my yarn stash! I cut a whole lot of lengths, roughly around 2 feet long, knotted them together in a randomish order and then wound it all up into a ball. They're mainly just solid acrylics, but there are some different textures in there too!
Then it was back home for my lovely bit of belly pork, mash, turnip, sprouts and carrots.
The literary critic William B. Dillingham has shown that as The Encantadas progresses, we encounter more recognisably human tortoises: Hunilla’s endurance and Oberlus’ “mindless bestiality” suggest, for Dillingham, “the most basic and mechanical form of energy, life without life.” Melville had subjected Hawthorne to offers of literary fellowship, which the grumpy author for his part seems to have politely discouraged, but Melville must have marvelled at how Hawthorne could have made a name for himself as a popular novelist (The Scarlet Letter had been published four years before The Encantadas) when he sold tales of a despair and woe unique within Western literature. Perhaps the picture of a salesman enthusiastically promoting a set of blighted islands – whose cursed citizens, ferocious slaveholders, and “permanent Riotocracy” present a travesty of American society – serves to indict, or at least to question, Hawthorne’s entire literary career.

So R.I.P. Chance. My mom named him that because we gave him a second chance at life and also because he gave us another chance at loving a cat. It's lonely without him here meowing at us, and when she gave him the sleeping shot he walked around and then when he started to fall over I grabbed him and held him. He crawled out of my arms and into my dad's lap where he fell asleep for the last time. Then she gave him the euthanasia shot. He was gone less than a minute later. I'm really happy that he fell asleep in my dad's lap. He loved to sit there and sleep, so it was perfect. My dad doesn't show when he's sad but I heard him sniffling as Chance fell asleep and my mom was on speaker phone and she was crying. I was suprised that it was just as hard to lose him as it was Ace and the cat I grew up with named C.C. because we'd only had chance for 14 months or so. But it was just as hard. As soon as he was gone I ran out of there because I couldn't handle seeing him on the table.

The article points out along the way how casting directors Paul Schnee and Kerry Barden found six key actors. After the production was completed and the film edited they hired various people from publicist Laura Kim to producer rep Josh Braun to guide them as they prepared to sell the film. They made a deal with Roadhouse Attractions even before the film was shown at Sundance or picked up its awards.

For some reason I have been signed up to attend another one of those Work Health check thingies. By myself. How do I get myself into these things? Anyway, I guess I need some symptoms, since that's the whole point, right? I get myself a set of symptoms, go in and tell them all about it, and they say I will die in a week? It's so relaxing knowing those doctors and nurses are coming round to our workplaces to look after us.

Going Potty:Mommy will try to situate herself so that you can't reach into the potty. Race her to get there first! Points given to the first to splash in the toilet water. After she has a seat, hit her repeatedly on the back with the toilet lid. Laugh maniacally. Climb up and down, up and down on the step stool in front of the sink. Open and shut the bathroom door repeatedly. Bonus points are rewarded if you are able to catch a part of your brother in the door as it shuts.
Last week, I painted a tall tree in a little girl's bedroom, to match her new owl/flower themed bedding. I loved the bright colors in her bedding set (this "Owl Nature Bedding", from Target), and had fun replicating a fun look for her tree!

4. Losing Hold (White, Argent) (5:32)
I got most of our Christmas cards done yesterday (yes, for 2008 - I'm that far behind). The Queen had her 5-year-old checkup so that's out of the way, and we're taking her pictures on Wednesday. So some of my relatives will not get their Christmas cards until those pictures come back, because I'm cheap that way. And we might as well just go ahead and stick the Valentines in there at the same time.

Funnily enough Rove also almost bought me a pair of tickets for the movie as well, but decided against it when he thought that I probably got mine already from the radio station. Instead he treated me to dinner which was just as cool. Sigma is giving me one of two options for my present. He told me that he was originally going to surprise me with a f DvD pack of the acting troop "Team Starkid" (Who are totally awesome) work along with their now semi legendary Headband that appears in each production. Then he had doubts all of a sudden and wanted to get me Infamous 2 instead. And then he just decided to ask me what I wanted instead. Now as much as I would love a new game right now, I'm going to go with the Starkid stuff. I have my reasons that I don't care to explain at the moment.

Everything has just collapsed in on me. I doubt I’ll reopen this blog, but I do still get updates when people like posts or comment. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at a standstill. Even though I’m doing things and working towards college, a license, a car, and a job…. it feels as though I’m watching someone else do it.

But, I've also begun to learn the basics of cooking and baking, which have produced delicious results. So now my tears come after I eat the food. Definitely worth it if you ask me. Especially to my husband, who now feels he should be my eternal slave to show his gratitude for so many amazing meals.
So, PURE is my eighteenth book, but, in so many ways, seems like my first. A post-apocalyptic thriller, it's such a huge departure for me, as a writer. I've written literary novels, whimsical novels for younger readers, women-centric fiction and three collections of poetry. I was in Best American Poetry last year and will be there again this upcoming year; I write contemplative personal essays that have appeared in The New York Times, Boston Globe, NPR ...

In terms of characters, I think these ones could have been better. Leah's sister was overwhelmingly naive and annoying. Her inner thoughts didn't match her age at all -- she seemed more like an eight-year-old rather than a twelve-year-old.
Even if you don't like coleslaw you should try it because my husband and daughter love this and still claim not to like coleslaw. We like it with pulled pork on buns (very American) and also as a side with oven fried chicken.
So, ‘per ardua ad astra’, as the builders of Stonehenge used to say when they went down to the pub after a bit of rock gardening. It’s going to mean some hard work, but I’ve always fancied the idea of space travel!
I wasn’t around then, but it’s my understanding that many of the “classic” instances used to be large singular instances. Instead of having the Great Barrow: The Maze, Thadúr and Sambrog, there was just the Great Barrow. After they received the makeover treatment, the instances were split up to balance them for more casual playing with some of the original instance left on the cutting room floor. For example, you might find guides such as this walkthrough for Helegrod which may make no sense if you’re trying to do it now.
The plan was that my friends would pick us up at the Streetsboro KOA at 6:30 PM, and I wanted to arrive at least a couple hours early so we had plenty of time to set up, walk the dogs, and freshen up. In fact, we even had time to take Sydney and Barley to the little KOA dog park and let them run around off -leash, which they really like.
Lauren ran from door to door with big Kaelin. Little Kaelin, stayed in her stroller with me. The girls had so much fun. Lauren would say "Trick or Treating" hehehe when asking for candy. It was too cute. When I'd say "Say, thank you, Lauren" she'd said "Thank you, Lauren" HA! Gotta love 2 year olds.
It filled me up.
Same goes for Led Zeppelin. I would trade Robert Plant for Terry Reid any day, but without Bonzo, there’s no Zep. No Page, no Zep. No Jones, no Zep. Instead you’d have the New Yardbirds.

If all it takes to delay or avoid charges is to commit so many potential violations as to overwhelm the system, can you imagine what next election is going to look like? Elections Canada can’t keep waiting until it’s fully investigated the hundreds of specific complaints into the 2011 election before it starts laying charges. Start processing the people already identified, and continue with the investigation. If a bank robber is caught, police don’t wait to charge him until they’ve determined if the robber is responsible for any other crimes also.
After my last week's weigh-in, even though I loss 2.6 lbs, I feel as though it could of been more, since I've had weeks with bigger losses when I've exercised less and ate more. Vicky suggested after my last post that maybe my calorie deficit being 2500+ is just TOO much. And she had read my mind because I was thinking the same thing. Maybe I need to eat MORE? I went back and looked at my food diary and BodyMedia Fit stats for the week I had such a big loss of 5.8 lbs, and I did eat more, I was averaging more around 1000/cal a day versus the 600-900 I have been eating the past few weeks. So I am going to try it out next week. I am going to make a better effort to eat BETTER foods, and keep my calories around 1000-1100 and see what that brings me. It also is my TOM this upcoming week though, so I need to remember not to have TOO high of expectations.. (who am I kidding, I am ME, it's impossible to not let myself down..[sigh]).....

I miss home too. A lot.
Promptly at 8 or so, I got to the airport. (There was surprisingly little traffic on the 405 – the only good karma of my travels), only to get to the USAirways desk and find out I didn’t have a seat. So, my seat was reconfirmed, again (redundant, but what happened) and I amused myself in the airport lounge for two hours while I waited for the Lufthansa gate to open. (That’s a really funny story, but not for this bitch session).
The other patient was a lovely lady who's heart arrythmia caused fainting spells (syncopal episodes) at home. With medications administered at the hospital, that arrythmia was now under control and she would probably be transferred to the floor the next day or even discharged home. We had a few nice conversations and I reinforced some of her health teaching. It was such a slow night that I finished all of my online education modules that aren't due till October and tried, mostly in vain, to help out the other nurses on the unit. A couple of them joked (semi-seriously) that I was so willingly helpful that I should transfer to their unit permanently. A nice compliment, but also a necessary trait on my home unit. Easy, easy night.

I am all about time saving and doing my regular cooking hour is all I can squeeze into a busy week. I do not want to add another few hours to make freezer meals but I love having them on hand. The easiest way I can fill my freezer without doing alot of extra work is to make more of what I am already making.

I graduated from high school in 1974. The state road people were working on a huge section of Interstate 79 that would alleviate my need for boring adjectives. I could not wait until they were finished with it. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to get home. The new interstate section would knock off at least thirty minutes of tiresome driving time. Please hurry state road people.

Everyone always say it is the worst day of the week – it’s my second favorite. I like Mondays, maybe it is the idea that it is the start of a new week of adventure, or the promise of actually doing something with my life ( even if that is spending hours drawing infinate elephants and debating movie quotes), I like Mondays. School is nice on Mondays, because everyone hates them, so by being cheerful, you become extra cheerful. Like extreme cheerful, altra happy , superawesomewickedsicktasticly cool ( yeah, I invented a word … it will catch on … maybe). I like to brighten peoples Mondays, whether it means thinking of something really funny, or putting on a cute face and bothering them till the smile. Otherwise they can be darn right boring ( as if I just used darn ..).

That would represent a remarkable turnaround from a fortnight ago when, after a crushing loss at Arsenal, City appeared out of contention eight points behind.
So today I'm studying the tapes of the opponent. I'm looking at pain, analyzing its trick plays, and working on my own strategies for leading people through the game victorious. It feels good. It feels fucking great actually.
4. SMELL the bar. This step is vital. Your nose can detect up to 200-300 aromas. A really good bar will have a distinctive parfum that should be savored before you place it in your mouth.
Second, spend some time in the word. We live in the age of tiny technology. If you have a smartphone, you can access the mobile version of biblegateway.com, or you can download the youversion app or the logos app. All these are free, and they are great resources for reading the bible in whatever translation you desire on the go. I use all three of these at different times, and they are really great! More than just reading the word, though, just read a verse or two, and meditate on that passage. You will find God often speaks to you through His word in ways that cut right to what you are dealing with, even if it’s a struggle with being patient while you wait for that incredibly slow train that is cutting the town in half while you are trying to get the kids to school on time.

I’ve been looking closely to a couple of WW2 skirmish games. I’m really letting NUTS! off the table right now, because I want something a bit bigger. NUTS! gets a little slow when you go beyond a couple of squads a side, and the tank rules never seemed nice to me.

13. Give up the past. I know, I know. It’s hard. Especially when the past looks so much better than the present and the future looks so frightening, but you have to take into consideration the fact that the present moment is all you have and all you will ever have. The past you are now longing for – the past that you are now dreaming about – was ignored by you when it was present. Stop deluding yourself. Be present in everything you do and enjoy life. After all life is a journey not a destination. Have a clear vision for the future, prepare yourself, but always be present in the now.
A while back, one of my so call "friends" on Facebook called me a "paranoid asshole" (or something like that) behind my back because of some of the songs I would not allow to be embedded. (If you don't know what embedded means, don't ask me; trust me.) Evidently he believes that the music should be shared for free and artists have no rights to complain if they're used without permission. Actually, I disagree. He has done books of cartoons portraying people from New Orleans and how we talk. Ironically, he sold them......for money!!!! I am not sure how he would feel if someone copied the books and gave them away for free, especially when they were just published!
And last night, as she was going down the stairs, she noticed my cat at the bottom of the stairwell, lying on the floor, looking up at her. Just as she reached the bottom of the steps – she heard “Here, kitty, kitty, kitty…”
No one ever likes to have to flex their authority. No one who is focused on growing deeply in holiness, that is. Authority as Bishop Morlino has said on numerous occasions isn't something he asked for, it was something he was given. His excellency has said that it can be a great burden. Nevertheless, he has been clear that his authority springs from fidelity to the Jesus Christ and His Church. He has recently written a letter to parishioners in Platteville, WI. You can read Bishop Morllino's letter to Platteville here.

Slowly, I have self-inflicted privacy erosion. When I Google myself, I’m startled with the amount of information I have revealed. The erosion probably started with my blog, which harkens back to May 2003. That’s about nine years of stuff that I can’t remember writing, but likely reveals a whole lot about me. Then three years ago, I got on Facebook. The invites from my real friends poured in. At first, it was fun. The older I get, the busier I am, the less I want to drive all around L.A. to see friends. It was like a wonderful window into the world of people I know well. Then it was a window into the world of people I know less well, but find humorous for some reason. Then it was a window into the world of people I knew from high school and college. It even, unfortunately, became a window into a world of annoying or shamelessly self-promoting people I now mostly block. Which is what real life is about, isn’t it? Growing up gives you the ability to restrict contact with some people, while expanding contact with others. It’s called a filter—and I want it back.

Pubs here are a heady mix of young & bolder-older. Daddylonglegged women in velvet garb drink at the same hatches as 70-something malcontents in woolly-horned Viking hats downing port. A great college buzz about the place at night even if noise levels give tinnitus a run for its money. Spent one night lodged in a Neachtain’s snug with some lovely Twitterfolk and another on a crawl North of the river, wondering into the bottomless fizz if I could live here full-time. A lot of unspoilt pubs with bubblewrap windows and simple wooden benches reminds of what Dublin so earnestly lost in the full tilt of boom. My favourite day time hang-out is Sheridan’s Wine Bar on Churchyard Street, opposite St. Nicholas’ Church (also worth a visit for the Jayne Eyre reference alone). You can share a cheeseboard here for a tenner and there’s rakes of yummy wines from around the world at €6 a glass.

I’ve been using work and obligations as a ruse just to stay at home when I know I shouldn’t. Not that I don’t like going out, because I do have work and obligations at home. But then, I’ve been neglecting my friends and I end up feeling all alone most of the time. I have forgotten how to have fun. It’s time to balance work and play so that I don’t end up sad most of the time.
Black currant leaves are most delicately scented in the spring and then is the time to use them for flavouring sweets and all kinds of puddings.This is my own special recipe: Boil 1lb. of white sugar with 1/2 pint water and a cupful of young blackcurrant leaves. Boil without stirring, for 15 minutes; then strain and pour the hot syrup very gently on to 2 beaten egg whites. Beat all the time, till the mixture begins to thicken; then stir in the juice of a lemon and a gill of whipped cream.
Then again, the danger in not having a plan is that I could end up writing the same novel for years and never get to the ending, or worse, the climax, so I do have to be careful.
My summation is this: I believe in capitalism and democracy. I also recognize that there are times that both have failings. That doesn’t mean that we abandon either, but we do need to recognize that both need tweaking from time to time, and maybe more importantly, sometimes things get so out of control that you need to temporarily throw the book out.

I've been thinking, and unless I'm much mistaken, I've never actually told the story of how I came to be an an unschooler... I simply popped up with a blog at age 17 saying "hey, I'm unschooled!". :-P So this is the story of how I came to be an unschooler! Some of it is taken from what my parents have said, since I was pretty young when some of this went down, but I'll do my best to tell it accurately!
Thursday I went flying out of work early and over to the middle school, after receiving a call from the guidance counselor that my 14-year-old, 8th-grade son was “involved in an incident.” Translation–he and another 8th-grader got into a namecalling, shoving match and the other kid (twice Josh’s size) picked him up and tossed him down the stairs. Hard tile stairs. Took him to the walk-in clinic for bruised hip and ginormous abrasion on his R forearm. He was so stiff he slept on the couch b/c he couldn’t climb the stairs to his room.

Getting there and getting home: I took a train from Paddington to Totnes.You can actually walk between Totnes Station and Dartington Hall, and I did this on the way back. It's only about two miles and it's a lovely walk, but I wouldn't recommend it if the weather looks at all dubious or if your suitcase is one with wheels rather than one like mine that travels on your back. It's mostly flat but with a hilly part near the hall. To get there, I took a taxi.

There were so many scripts floating about by even top notch writers like Tom Stoppard, penning an Indy script became a rite of passage for screenwriters. At comic book and science fiction convention, you would here at least a half dozen claims someone had read a script by the latest hot writer and just knew that was going to be the script. I am certain hardly any of that was true, but if you spend even a few minutes on Google looking, you can find all sorts of scripts for the fourth Indy. None apparently managed to satisfy the big three until now.

Now I'm not talking about loving em all night long at the same time, if you know what I mean, What two (or more) consenting adults do in private is completely down to them.
3. Appreciation and new found loyalty for certain businesses. It’s nice to know that there are still companies out their that care about their quality and level of customer service. These companies that use mystery shoppers are making sure they are delivering the best services or goods as possible and ensuring their employees are working up to expectations. I find myself appreciating these companies that use mystery shoppers. Because they go that extra mile to follow up on themselves and care about how their business is run, I actually frequent these places a little more often.
3. The decision from Social Security has been made but we don't know what it is yet...we have to wait for it to come in the mail! We are of course hoping for the positive and that we will get some financial support since Rodney cannot work. So we should know soon...I will let you know!!!!
She played out a little bit. And after she moved to New York she still played out a little bit but now she was in the Pay To Play world, and that’s a big step down. It’s a step down in skill and a necessary step down in attitude. And now she, I, me, whoever it is who’s left here, has mostly given up on the whole thing. Certainly I’ve given up on “getting somewhere”. By the time I moved to NYC the best I could have hoped for was to just play around town once in a while, but now I don’t even think about that.
Trevor (step-son - 12) seems to be a touch ADD also in my opinion but my opinion doesn't matter much with his mom. LOL He's a wonderful kid and fit right in with my kids from the very beginning. I expected him to have a hard time since he was an only child and doted on by both of his parents. He shares his dad very well though with my kids. The biggest issue we tend to have with him is that he has a bad habit of lying. Other than that though, he's a wonderful little boy with more girlfriends that we can keep up with. (He's got his dad's charm and wit.)
Recept: (Sigh) Yes, he is.
Now, we just found a place that seems kind of amazing. Washer/dryer IN the unit, allows dogs up to 60 lbs, parking spot with storage plus decent street parking, hardwood/tile floors throughout. There's going to be a unit available that's getting completely remodeled. New countertops, appliances, bathroom, all new. The FH is just hesitant because we would really lose the walkability we currently have.
These are amazing beings in any reality. Their powers are mighty, and their beingness is mighty. Now, you have need to understand that the Godhead has surrounded themselves with the most beautiful, with the highest energy. And so, these are beings of adoration, and these are beings that you will often hear us refer to as those of the pink ray—it is pink-gold, actually. And their purpose is simply to be in attendance, in adoration. They are the singers of hosanna and praise.
I would like to think Adventure Sports Journal rejected the last couple articles I submitted to them due to artistic differences. But the unfortunate truth is these last couple articles, to put it into literary terms, sucked.

Carbon dioxide mixed with water produces carbonic acid making the oceans more and more acidic and increasingly sick. For example, it takes thirty parts of alkalinity in the form of sodium bicarbonate to buffer or neutralize one part or one molecule of carbonic acid in order to maintain a pH of 8.2 - the healthy pH of our oceans. Thus, the chemistry to buffer carbonic acid in the oceans is a thirty to one ratio. This means thatit is going to be virtually impossible to reverse this catastrophic situation unless we do something about decreasing the emissions of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere--and do it NOW!

This power will not function underground or anywhere that is not open to the outside (such as inside a windowless room). Any of the above uses of the power require an action to "set" and then the winds will continue to behave in that manner for the rest of the duration or until another action is spent to change their behavior.

We all love vampires, but what's the deal with all the 'good' ones in films like We are the Night (2nd down from top, below), Interview with a Vampire, Near Dark, and others I'm sure I can't remember, wherein people become vampires only to also become pious, refusing to slaughter innocent humans, feeling guilty about it when they do, and giving the vampires who kill and drink humans a rough time, worse than preachy vegans. Give them a goblet of blood they'll drink it and never ask where it came from, but killing humans is, like, wrong, just like the 'good' Terminator can only shoot humans in the legs, and Batman even risks collateral lives to not run over the Joker on his gay little scooter (The Dark Knight).

And in the end, much as I hate the “if it bleed, it leads” mandate of the news shows, it irks me even more that Disney and Nickelodeon and even PBS purport to celebrate an active and imagination-filled childhood while actually working to undermine it, by feeding kids a constant diet of crack. Er…kiddie shows. (And let’s not even get into the fact that almost all of those shows have product tie-ins — Disney supposedly sells 40,000 different princess items. So they are basically out to capture our kids’ imagination, money and childhood. ) But otherwise, they’re great. — Lenore

So there we are getting pointers from the Hulk, drunkenly trying to take it all in. The main strategy, which we had figured out fairly early in the season, was to try and take out the other team’s best players first. That way it is easier to pick off the weaklings at the end, the ones that can’t catch. Hopefully, if you are following this logic correctly, you’ve already figured out that this means that I am consistently the last one on my team left on the court. Hulk pointed out to me that the best thing to do in this situation is to back into a corner when it’s the other team’s turn to throw and go for a catch. It’s the only hope really, as my weak arm is never getting anybody on the other team out.
I also have it on good authority that we can expect some great things from Atlantic Records, perhaps even around their fantastic Studio1290 property (go ahead, re-size your browser, the site is totally responsive)

However, for many the erosion of our culture has been so gradual and piecemeal that, even many of those who suspect that something is happening, do not yet realise how far it has gone and how narrow are the remaining planks on which they stand.
Rule #1: My parents always used to say that “life is not fair” – what one sibling gets another may not. Everyone does not earn the same income or get the same things. That is life. You get what you get and you get what you work for and sometimes you don’t. You may do everything you are supposed to do and there is a chance that things will not go your way. Everyone does not win.
I appreciate being with people who “get it.” I know talking parenting is different with other parents of special needs kids. I know talking about medicine or life and death issues is different with other cancer survivors. I know that being with other women is different than being in a mixed group. Even being with a group of women “of a certain age” is different than being in a multigenerational group. Talking spirituality with other Pagans is different than talking spirituality with Christians or Jews or Muslims. Shared experience does count.

I understand in America that many things are simplified and modified under guise of accessible to a wider audience. I can never forget my disgust in picking up a Bible and reading it, and watching Johnathon and David solemnly shake hands, vs the weeping and hugging and far more emotive expressions of friendship, joy, relief and more. It struck me as gender policing and homophobic and completely erasing the historical context (such as it is after hundreds of years and myriad scribing) and also the cultural context.
Many would ask why they should support Labour and give them their vote if it just means the continuation of Con-Dem policies? For others, because there is currently no mass workers' party which puts forward a real alternative to the Con-Dem cuts, there is a hope against hope that Labour will be able to get rid of the Tories, and stop at least the worst of the cuts.

I've been reading (and re-reading) the Journals of Alfred Doten as part of researching my Western Mysteries stories set in and around Virginia City in the early 1860s. Like Mark Twain, Alf Doten was a failed prospector turned journalist. Throughout his life he kept meticulous and detailed journals, recounting the weather, cost of things and concrete details of life in the California gold fields and later on the Comstock, in Nevada.

Sometimes you want a scene that doesn’t exactly answer necessary questions. Perhaps you have more game time left than story, or maybe the players want to spend time talking to an NPC. Either way, these scenes can be fun, but they can really slow down the pace of a game. Be careful about using these scenes often.

David Halperin’s recent book, What Do Gay Men Want? (2), explores the possibilities of a re-theorization of gay subjectivity in opposition to the psychological questions raised by the putative rise in gay men’s increasingly risky sexual behavior. Let me summarize very briefly: Halperin argues that the moralizing public conversation about “barebacking” slides easily and quickly into a psychologically (re)pathologizing discourse that locates gay male subjectivity in the perverse, abnormal, dieased, self-hating, etc.–the very discourses gay men and women have been working to overthrow since at least the 1960s.(3) Halperin explains the rise in risky behavior in signifantly different terms, seeing gay men as ongoing agent-negotiators-resisters who opt for safer strategies of risk reduction to maximize or maintain access to pleasure; he uses epidemiological and sociological research to demonstrate the rationality (as opposed to pathology, but not in a rational choice sense of the word) of gay men’s sexual choices in the face of what is known about HIV transmission, and moves to an etended engagement with an essay by Michael Warner from a 1994 Village Voice in which Warner discloses his own risky behavior and calls for an explanation and engagement with gay male subjectivity on its own terms. The essay is of great importance to those working in public health in HIV prevention among men who have sex with men, but I’m going to leave aside those issues for my purposes here in talking about the implications of Halperin’s emergent theory of gay male subjectivity (4) and what it ma reveal about the gay men I studied and the normative conclusions I drew from my research.
PUSHING FOR EVEN greater austerity measures, eurozone leaders are ignoring the reality that Greece’s debts are absolutely unsustainable. While political leaders are repeatedly stating their determination to defend the eurozone and avoid a breakup, strategists closer to the investment banks and other financial institutions are quite clear that, sooner or later, there will be a Greek default. That would mean a Greek exit from the eurozone.

"In Toronto today, almost 95% of all cases of TB in the city are from people born in other parts of the world," explains Khan, an infectious diseases physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital. "That's because in many parts of the developing world, access to medicines to treat TB is not available." TB is a serious and contagious disease with a long incubation but most people exposed to it (that's about one-third of us, globally) have healthy immune systems to keep the germ in check. But some people who may have acquired TB in their home countries may develop the disease even decades after coming to Canada. If the disease is dormant, the chest screening that is done for immigration purposes may show nothing. Only if their X-ray is abnormal is a new Canadian given a skin test to see if they have TB in its active form. Even if they do not, those with abnormal X-rays are put under surveillance when they arrive -- seen by a doctor and followed by the local public health department. A TB skin test can confirm whether or not you're a carrier or have the disease. But that test is not part of the immigration exam, says Khan. Of the 250,000 new immigrants to Canada each year, Khan estimates that 85,000 could be carriers. Their inactive infection could be easily treated, but if they develop active TB, they would require a lengthy and very costly multi-antibiotic treatment.
“Lacking any compelling evidence of net harm to society from correcting misperceptions of the relative risk between cigarettes and snus, the human right for the individual to receive accurate information about options to reduce risk should prevail. Going beyond the no-safe-tobacco message to provide better informa¬tion … is necessary to respect the individual right to health relevant information and smokers’ autonomy and may also—as our study indicates—result in increased quit rates for cigarette smoking. Some have argued that failure to disseminate infor¬mation about reduced risks for fear that population nicotine use may increase could be regarded as paternalism and create public mistrust of health messages about tobacco use. To prevent uptake of snus among youth, public health and tobacco control professionals could use other methods than withholding information about relative risks, including taxation, restrictions, and information campaigns aiming to change the cultural symbolism of snus use…Devising a way to inform smokers about the risk contin¬uum of tobacco products (without anyone decoding this infor¬mation as snus being risk free) should be an important research priority in countries where snus is allowed to compete with cigarettes for market share.”
We have a kegerator at work, and it is currently empty. It is empty because we can't seem to find a decent source of small/pony kegs. When we have giant parties, we go thru standard sized kegs, no problem. But our office staff of 9 can't seem to kill a keg in a timely manner, and the lines get gross, and by then, well, it's just too late. We all like interesting beer, and variety. We have good beer in the fridge, but it just seems like a waste to have a kegerator and not use it.
I see free and open source software (FOSS) as the best alternative. For example, why risk yourself by using illegally acquired Windows OS when you can use Linux or FreeBSD? There are many free OS available. However, I don’t discount the fact that many users are familiar to Windows environment than any other operating system. But for users who prefer to do what is right, what is legal, and what moral, he will find ways to learn linux – that is if he can’t afford Windows OS.

This concept of low access to healthy food options in low socio-economic communities led to the term “food desert.” A food dessert is defined by the U.S. government as “a low-income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store.” There are more than 6,500 food deserts in the continental U.S. (food desserts are not yet defined for Hawaii and Alaska) and 75 percent of them are in urban areas. Some studies have correlated low access to healthy food options to higher obesity rates.

During its two-decade history, two out of three individuals applying for federal vaccine injury compensation have been turned away empty-handed even though to date $1.8B has been awarded to more than 2,200 plaintiff's out of some 12,000 who have applied. Today, nearly 5,000 vaccine injury claims are sitting in limbo because they represent children, who suffered brain and immune system dysfunction after vaccination but have been diagnosed with regressive autism, which is not recognized by the program as a compensable event. There is $2.7B sitting in the Trust Fund which could have been awarded to vaccine victims.

So you’ve found your Goldilocks plot – not too big and definitely not too small. Now it’s time to start living the dream and turning vague ideas of your ideal house into a reality. Whichever route you take, it’s worth noting down what you want from your new home, such as the approximate size, rooms needed, and how you want to use those spaces. Think about how you live now and how you’d like to improve on your current home.

Comedy double act Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball originally met in the early 1960s in Oldham, Lancashire. Apparently they began working the northern club circuit as singers (not that you'd know that from listening to this drivel), switching to comedy after being told that comics earned more money.
Since I was just doing a “dry run” and not a full-fledged shopping trip, at the first store I decided to get just one package of each item I had on my list to see how long it would take on average to navigate the aisles I needed to go to, then extrapolate that time over the number of stores I planned to visit — since food items are clustered together, I figured that the time spent picking up assorted non-food items around the store would be a better indication of how long it would take to navigate each store, then once I had picked up those items I would finish my shopping in the grocery section.

I was harangued into reading this by the ever-fabulous Lunameth. And I’m glad she did! I think the word “lyrical” is the best way to describe these stories – because, essentially, they are a lot of short stories bundled into one long thread. Which is what I quite enjoyed this book – little bite size pieces that were each enjoyable in themselves, but even better strung together. I really don’t have much more to say on the matter because it’s a book that has to be read, not talked about. If you’re a fantasy writer, you MUST READ THIS BOOK. It gave me more inspiration than any writing exercise book ever could. If you like fairy tales, fantasy novels, short stories or even lots and lots of description, this book is for you.

This is just a gimmick, and the fact that they really just added alcohol to Bud Light doesn’t make it drinkable. In fact, I’d rather drink my two Bud Lights and enjoy them rather to get the same alcoholic effect than to feel like “eh, I just drank a sub par beer.”
Ann Milton in her role as health minister should not be expressing such certainty about such important issues when the evidence does not justify it. That is seriously to mislead the public.

Certainly blurs the line when having a discussion on who is instructing / advising the athlete. The coach is looking at performance - but answers to someone other than the athlete in many cases. The agent is looking at earnings and how to achieve them. But he too answers to someone other than the athlete - typically a management group or a shoe company. The shoe company and meet promoters are looking at a combination of performance and appearances, with the goal being to make money off of the appearances and performances of the athlete. Physical therapists, nutritionists, masseuses are looking at how to affect physical fitness and therefore performance - and of course the better the athlete does the better they get paid.
You got a big bump on your head a couple of weeks ago while we were visiting Becky and Baby Leah. You leaned forward into their coffee table and BAM! Immediate, big, dark bruise and bump. You cried so hard; I felt awful. Of course, you refused to let me put ice on it, the one thing that would have helped you feel better (Besides some comfort nursing, which....yeah. I love being able to provide you relief and comfort any time!). Then last night we were at a wedding with you, and you fell forward and banged your chin on one of the folding table legs. Today, you have a big dark bruise on your chin. You are a walking (crawling) disaster. I have a feeling I may need to print out copies of this blog as proof of your recklessness and daring, because I think after your third broken arm the hospital is going to call CPS on us.
As you already know, I try to give our images a name- mainly so that it's easier for me to identify and remember. It also gives me a chance to name them after friends and family or just names that I like. Kenichi is the name of one of our friend's sons who is still a toddler. Kenichi looks like a young boy, so I thought it matched him.

And this is kind of important when it comes to reporting ‘cyber crime’ and ‘cyber terrorism’. One cannot underestimate the ego on these guys; it’s what fuels their hacker battles, it’s what makes them advertise their activities to the world and, ultimately, it’s what gets them caught (which is why Anonymous used to have a habit of outing anyone who tried to rise to prominence or said they spoke for the collective). And caught they have been.
It's actually dangerous to not wake a sleepwalker, but many have believed this myth for ages because, perhaps, a few of them have gotten smacked when they woke up their startled somnambulatory friends. Sleepwalkers are certainly prone to feeling that surprise when they don't wake up in their beds but, rather, at the outer limits of their camping grounds. (Oh wait, that was me when I was 10.) Because this is so disorienting, many woken sleepwalkers won't know who you are and become frightened. That said, letting them just walk wherever they want

One of the best selling books today is A Course of Miracles. From it I quote; “There is no sin. A slain Christ has no meaning. The journey to the cross should be the last ‘useless journey’. Do not make the pathetic error of “clinging to the Old Rugged Cross.” The name of Jesus Christ is but a symbol…it is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the names of all the gods to which you pray.” It is a best seller.
Like Cranberries & Brie on Lemon Thins. This is a great idea for leftover cranberry sauce. Just spoon some of your leftover cranberries over a chunk of brie (this particular photo has my Cabernet Cranberry Sauce) and serve it with Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins. I found my cookie thins at Trader Joe's, but you can find other brands at the 'regular' grocery store.

Finally, the Titanic story transcends all cultures and all ages because it is about human choice. The French philosopher Albert Camus, once said: “Life is the sum of all your choices”. And the Titanic disaster, reminiscent of a Greek tragedy, reminds us that in the face of death, the most sublime and the most wretched of human choices had to be made. The Titanic drama played over two hours and forty minutes, enabling the survivors to witness and give precise and chilling accounts of the excruciating choices people made at the time of the sinking. A few men chose to disguise themselves in woman’s clothing or jump onto a lifeboat as it was being lowered, to escape a certain death. Others, including my great grandfather, hurried a relative or loved one to the safety of a lifeboat. Some men, including the wealthiest amongst them, showed never seen before chivalry and fortitude. Colonel Astor and his pregnant wife gave up their seats on a lifeboat to leave room for a Third Class woman and her child. Mr. Guggenheim chose to dress up in his best suit. The Band chose to play music till the end. Brave women chose to remain and die with the men they loved. Some chose to kneel down and pray.
Love stays when everyone else has gone home or moved on love still lingers. Love grows with each passing moment of separation and each stroke of the pen to paper. Love never no never fails! Although the relationship ended, or the person left love didn’t fail. Love is something that you can hold on too long after the lover has gone. Love never fails. That’s why Love deserves an Oscar.

I wanted to ask him if he would help me re-program the front seat on my Silverado, that I couldn’t figure out how to do. “Sure", he said, "lets go look at it”. When I shut it off and remove the key, the seat automatically slides all the way back so you can easily get out, which is fine. However, then when you come back and unlock the doors the seat automatically slides way up forward. So far forward, that I can’t even get in. Then I have to push a button on the dash and to move it back into my previously memorized position. I told Bill I wanted it just to stay all the way back until I get in, then I can push the button and have it slide into my memorized "personal" position. Bill says, “OK, we can do that”. He pushed a few buttons, turned the key switch off and on a couple times and said “There, try that”. Awwww....perfect, that’s the way I want it. Whew, glad to get that done. I must have tried to do that 50 times and couldn’t get it right. I knew Bill could do it. So we were off to see Prescott....you know the usual places, Costco, Sam’s and Wal-Mart. Then, of course, the Gun Shop!!

Some of these girls do marry well--surprisingly so! But they are amongst the few. As for the rest, they make their own lives and their husband's a burden to them. Without having time given them to mature their ideas, these latter are hurried into matrimony while still children, without having formed a conception of the terrible responsibility that attaches itself to every human soul who agrees to join itself to another.

With the transition from Christopher Eccleston to David Tennant, it seemed easy and natural. I imagine that’s the way it’s always been. Not having followed the show previously, I can’t say for certain. The phenomenon of David Tennant’s Dr is something else, again. And, knowing that he did, indeed, want to leave the show, in watching the last scene with him, I completely believed that his Dr did not. It’s as though that character on the screen really did have a life of his own apart from the actor portraying him. I hope there’s an award in there some place for this.

Wilson is still too little to go trick or treating or really even understand what Halloween is, so it's still a pretty quiet holiday for us. I can't wait until he is older and can actually understand and be excited for dressing up and getting candy.
"...banners work like most advertising, which is to say in a fairly complex manner.For instance, click-through is actually a poor measure of performance. It’s impossible to click through a billboard ad, for example, but that doesn’t mean it’s not effective... The same is true for TV ads..." Oh, I see. The now famous "nobody ever clicked on a TV spot" defense.
At one point they were introduced to Mitzi Beach, a psychologist and counselor who was dressed so that Eamon said if he saw her on the street he would've thought she was a bag lady. Afterwards they found out that after meeting them Beach ran to her office and called Superintendent Burke and told him that Antonette and Eamon were in the building. Then Tim O'Brien, an assistant principal joined them and Eamon asked how often they see Superintendent Burke. Both Henry and O'Brien burst out laughing simultaneously and replied, "We never see him."
WRITE UP #2: I received a negative score for an online survey. Apparently, a table complained that my service was slow even though we weren't busy. There weren't any details given to me about this table and I have no idea of the circumstances surrounding this table. Curiously, there were a lot of problems with the computers crashing/acting funny at this time...no idea if that was the case on this day. I didn't even know how to defend myself.

Yep. Immediately. From what I’ve been told, I was born with my birthfather at my birthmom’s side, she held me, and then that was it. I spent three days in foster care. After adjusting to that environment, I was placed in the cradle of my parent’s family tree. Scientifically, more and more, research is showing that the baby is deeply affected by this. Each change of environment, each relinquishment, and each loss develops a brain differently than the babies who are born and kept by their moms. OK. So, I was a baby. I didn’t “know” what I was going through, I was just going. And, to carry through the pinball idea . . . I was bounced by a couple of bumpers until I got to a safe place (to my parents who raised me and are the grandparents to my children today).
The first ‘chapter’ is called the Prologue (which means it isn’t actually a ‘chapter’ but whatever). It takes place back in the day when Stormwind had just finished being rebuilt (which I say happened in Year 20. Nothing seems to be entirely clear on that). Creme is a young girl, around 5 or so, and her mother, Elise, is taking her to Stormwind to the planned celebration/collection of payment for the workers (Elise is collecting her late-husband’s wages). However, things end up badly when the workers learn there is no payment and riots begin. Elise is killed in these riots, leading off to a very depressing start.

Next stop was Uyuni down in the south of Bolivia. Things didn’t start off very well for us. After being picked up and taken for breakfast, we were supposed to leave for our tour shortly after. Two and half hours waiting at the diner, we figured something was wrong. I walked 20mins around town to find the office of our tour agency closed. Fortunately, a car pulled up and let me in, and then the chap just left. At this moment in time, I was not impressed. Another 10mins passed by, and our travel agent came in and told us she would have to postpone our tour to the next day as there wasn´t enough tourists (the rest of our supposed group had cancelled last-minute). We managed to get free accommodation, lunch dinner and internet access for the day, not that it was a substitute for the wasted day from our busy schedule. But we accepted.
Personally I think its only a matter of time before we see canned craft beer in the UK and I think whoever does it first will have a great marketing angle to help the advertising of their beer. No prizes for who's been thinking about canning recently.

Conkeldurr (and its family) is the Gen V version of Machamp (and its family). Both are 3-stage evolution pure Fighting types; both Conkeldurr and Machamp were evolved by trading, and both have 75%-25% male-female ratio; and both can be female, even though the Pokemon looks very male by human standards.
Another deplorable feature of post-war fashion is the peaked cap for civilians: this, however, is so far confined to districts like Strasbourg, St Denis and La Vilette, and goes with a grubby raincoat and a toothbrush moustache. Small boys wear rabbit skins sewn together when it is cold and dungarees or battle-dress when it is warm.
I bring all this up because a few female authors of late have taken umbrage at the packaging of their books, complaining that the marketing strategy is too female, and that the publishers are selling the authors short. Most recently Polly Courtney dropped her publisher because of cover art she claimed made her novels seem like chick-lit.

After the first time I threatened to do it, I eventually got some responses making sure I was ok. But no-one rushed, and it really saddened me. If I had seen such a message, I wouldn’t have sent a pathetic text or phoned in the morning. I would have rushed straight round and leant on the doorbell until I was let in. Obviously I’m an exceptionally good friend.

There actually was someone there sitting on the white lobby couch. It was an old lady who looked like she was trying disastrously hard to be a young lady. She must have been about eighty, wearing a red taffeta dress adorned with tiny pom poms and outlandish makeup smeared across her face. . . . and most disturbing of all, red lipstick that was half on her lips and half on her teeth. She sat there smiling broadly at me. Frozen, it seemed, or locked in time. . . .

There are miles of footpaths and bridleway that allow you to explore on the park on foot, bike or horseback. The landscape features agricultural land, woodland, grasslands and a large pond, the Reigh (pronounced Reeth). This pond, and the woodland beside it, are managed by Newcastle City Council as a nature reserve, and provide a home for many creatures, such as red squirrels and kingfishers.

“Girls” is, in other words, a particularly galling example of tokenism, in which the only unsung voices we’re allowed to hear are the ones that fit the other prejudices of the people operating the sound system. Just as it’s not progress in representations of people of color if the only ones we see are drug dealers or welfare moms, it’s not progress in representations of women if the only ones we see aren’t all that different from the Carrie Bradshaws to whom we’ve already been overexposed. By all means, if people find this show interesting and entertaining, they should watch. But they shouldn’t be telling the world that it’s some sort of feminist triumph when there’s so, so much else that’s wrong with it.

The reserve is best known for its warblers (sedge, grasshopper and reed) and there have been sightings of corncrake, water rail and quail; it's a stronghold of owls and hen harriers too, and of polecats, badgers, voles and shrews. We saw none of these, though I'm sure they're there in numbers. Even on good day, I suspect it's one of those places that you spot only a few species.

I know we tend to think of “the olden days” as a time when women necessarily married for money and then pined away for love all the rest of their days, but in the 19th century ideas of romantic love and “companionate marriage” were superseding the old patriarchal model of arranged, economic marriages. This was the golden age of all things sentimental. I can’t listen to this song without laughing, but if I were a Victorian lady, I’d probably be bawling my eyes out.
Anyway, shy of it or proud of it, the truth is that Indian Astrology is a conglomerate composite of classical global astrological culture mixed with its ancient original roots. No doubt, ancient Indian astrology was very highly developed, but again there is no doubt that it was quite unlike the sign-and-house based system Vedic astrologers and Jyotishis use so heavily today.

Next we had the pleasure of seeing Rupert Murdoch and his son James appear last week before the Department of Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons to answer questions about the phone hacking scandal. Here again the weakness of the questioning system may have allowed wilful errors, if there were any, by the Murdochs to go unpunished. I should say, as a preliminary point, that they were not placed on oath, but “Erkine May” the bible of Parliamentary procedure makes it clear that lying to or misleading Parliament can amount to a contempt of Parliament, which is punishable by Parliament.

For film lovers, the publication of Leonard Maltin’s 2012 Movie Guide ($20.00, Plume, softcover) is an annual treat, filled with information of the many new films that have debuted in the previous year and tons of news about virtually every film including the older classics. The 2012 edition has nearly 17,000 entries that include more than 300 new ones, plus listings of more than 12,000 DVD and 12,000 videos. The guide includes an updated index of leading performers and directors, along with Maltin’s all-new theatrical recommendations. This book is virtually indispensable for anyone who loves films, old and new. Hollywood, the military, even criminals along withother aspects of our culture have gifted us with all manner of phrases that have been incorporated into our daily conversations. Alan Axelrod has gathered them together in The Cheaper the Crook, the Gaudier the Patter: Forgotten Hipster Lines, Tough Guy Talk, and Jive Gems ($12.95, Skyhorse Publishing, softcover) that is great fun if you’re a language buff. Terms like “drugstore cowboy”, “button man”, “Glad rags”, and many more can be found in its pages, gathered from World Wars One and Two, the Depression, prohibition, and the Jazz Age.

Today is Safer Internet Day, with a focus this year on learning to be safe online together, intergenerationally. I think this is a great focus as I think often some of the 'be safe online' advice that we are encouraged to give to the young is too broad and basic, and starts from too scared a position. It's like the standard 'stranger danger' advice given to primary age children that makes me more than a little nervous. Kids are, statistically, more at risk from people known to them than strangers, and many younger kids are led to believe that greeting neighbours (whom you see often but don't 'know' in any real sense) is dangerous or somehow bad.

This administrative outrage, of course, is highly selective. Imagine the following counter-example. A couple of Duke professors pen a research paper noting (correctly) that opposition to marriage equality skews toward under-educated segments of the population. Duke’s Christian student organization, whose members oppose marriage equality but who see an association with poorly educated people as personally offensive to their religious beliefs, pen a letter wailing that “the implications and intentions of this research at the hands of our very own prestigious faculty, seemingly without a genuine concern for proactively furthering the well-being of the Christian community is hurtful and alienating.” The Christian students demand “a dialogue” with the paper’s authors “that addresses our concerns about research’s intent, methodology, analysis and conclusion, in addition to its validity.”

Nevertheless, the question about contagion really hinges on the ECB at this point. The EFSF is too small to deal with either Spain or Italy effectively while they attempt to get back under the 3% hurdle and their bond spreads remain extra-wide. And the ECB is an unreliable provider of liquidity. The resignation of ECB chief economist Juergen Stark tells us that. When I say “the euro zone is coming apart at the seams now”, I mean that political cohesion is all but gone. The policy outlook is extremely volatile as major policy makers in the EU, in member states, and at the ECB have extremely discordant policy messages. Some like the Dutch Prime Minister are openly talking of how to break up the euro.

Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.

Apple sold quite a lot of Core Duo Macs and some Core Solo Mac minis. Those Macs do not meet the system requirements to run OS X Lion. Thus iCloud is not supported on those Macs. I am still using a MacBook Pro Core Duo from January 2006. I can only use iCloud through iCloud.com. In the meantime Apple is committed to run MobileMe service until June 30, 2012. By that time Apple would hope that Mac users would have at least an iOS 5 device or a Mac running OS X Lion.

I suppose they'll need to do more sorting before they can settle in completely. I had the pleasure of joining them after work on Tuesday to see the appartment, and help them with a bit of lifting. The movers had been there earlier that day, and so all they had to do was empty the boxes and put their furniture in their designated spots.
There were five ziplines on the tour we picked. I’ll tell you why I picked this tour: kids as young as eight could do it. I figured if an eight year old could do it, I could too. (Disclaimer: this theory doesn’t apply to roller skating. Trust me…I know.)

OK I hear you say, this isn’t brain surgery, why are you telling me this? Take a look around your home. There may be paintings done by the kids but what else is there? My son was playing being a pirate one day and asked if I had any treasure. Of course I have, I told him but he was very surprised that it did not contain any jewellery rather my Weight Watchers card which showed how much weight I had lost, his milk teeth, an old playing card that I got on an excellent night out. None of these treasures has any intrinsic value, but they are priceless too.
All of us have been very busy at the brewery. Byron, Cory and I are brewing up batches of our smoked beer, Boucanee. After each batch is ready there is also the kegging of the fresh beer and cleaning the fermenters and tanks, and then delivering of the filled kegs to our distributors across the state.
There are a few more weeks until Easter! Since the beginning of Lent, we have heard of the many opportunities to attend confession. But what exactly is confession and why do we need to attend confession? How do I make a good confession?

The investigators found that the differences between the brains of research subjects who were meditators and the brains of non-meditators in the control group weren’t limited to a core region of the brain but instead involved large-scale networks of the entire brain, as well as limbic structures and the brain stem.

The app has a simple interface and is easy to use. The flow of ink is feels “natural” and smooth and is similar to a felt tip pen. If you use your finger instead of a stylus, it appears wrist protection of some sort is built in so that when parts of your hand other than your finger tip rest on or touch the screen, it is not registered. Although there is no landscape mode, for free, you can’t go wrong. More than that, this app does have a feel of paper and pen. Download it today and experience what digital paper and pen feels like.
What?? You don't know what Rosella Jam is!?! It's an old Aussie recipe that is made from the fleshy red calyx (kind of a mix of fruit and flower) and bracts that are around the seed of the Wild Rosella bush. There are many differents forms of recipe for making Rosella Jam although the traditional one can be found HERE although I think THIS or THIS looks easier!! When I asked about making Rosella Jam I was simply told -

When you are querying, you just want an agent. When you get an agent, you just want a book deal. Once you have the book deal, you want your editorial letter. You’re anxious to move into revisions, and line edits, and copy edits, and cover art, and ARCs, and marketing, and tours, and reviews, and seeing your book on a store shelf. And then you want to sell the next novel, and the next, and repeat the process all over again.
But if I have an ingredient that is rare or just not popular in the States (potimarron, Jerusalem artichokes, etc), I turn to Marmiton. Marmiton is a less "professional" in that visitors to the site can post their versions of the recipes or even submit a recipe, but this often means they're more homey and less complicated.

TomP, August 2011
A lazy-holic is addicted to being lazy. We all know her. She is the one who procrastinates about everything, manages to get some things done but would much rather be on the couch watching the most recent episode of whatever recorded on the DVR. I masked my lazy in bursts of industry, the laundry got done, the family got fed, the house got cleaned but I was still lazy. The dogs didn’t get walked…they have a back yard after all…why do they need to get walked every day? A lazy-holic considers physical activity with reservation and resignation rather than joy and the sense of well being.

There are two very well known communist journalists in Australia’s past. One is the often villified, but extremely important Wilfred Burchett; the other is lesser-known, but equally important Rupert Lockwood. Burchett was hounded out of Australia and accused of being a Chinese spy. I think that charge is unfair and that he should be remembered more for his fantastic reporting from Hiroshima after the American atomic bomb attack.
Cole and Frank James had fought together under Quantrill, with Jesse eventually joining under Bloody Bill Anderson at the age of 16. They weren't the only ex-soldiers who decided to fight back against banks and institutions, but they would become the most famous, first under Archie Clement, and then as the James-Younger Gang when Clement was killed.
Well so lot has changed. though thankfully one thing has stayed the same. Food lion is going pretty well. Had a bit of trouble but now I have a gold star, one of my managers christy told me she noticed I am a hard worker. So for that I am glad. Sometimes customers are really annoying ( leaving register to get stuff or if they forget card, raising cain if something isn't on sale though it's not my fault , not helping back even though there is a loooooooot of stuff etc) but for the most part it's good. So I am glad for that. Oh and reaaaaaally long shifts can suck too. Which I have tomorrow. yaay. I also have had to work sunday mornings which suck.
I say "we" despite not being white because I believe Singaporeans are like that too, although we definitely have less of this complex than Americans. I don't blame the Americans, it is their media which made them this way... Shows like Oprah, for example.

When I was in my late 30s and saw the movie The Cell, Jennifer Lopez’s character was watching this movie and when I saw the image of the Blue aliens I got one of the biggest shocks of my life, as I’d almost totally forgotten this movie up until that point. I can barely recall a few memories where I wondered where I’d seen blue aliens, just thoughts out of the blue, but of course this movie explores many themes of spirituality and technology, of Self vs. Other, of what it is to be human, of superiority vs. inferiority complexes.

Anyways I'm still in recovery mode...Its amazing how being sick can really reduce you back to the basics. Yesterday was my first day back eating solid food- after each small meal I was so worn out I proceeded to take a one to two hour nap. It was pretty awesome, I'm not going to lie. It was a small glimpse of the beauty that could be my retirement.
I had wondered if I would ever need the item. It was quite expensive, it used batteries which is something I despise only slightly less than recharge only items, and I had no real use for it, then. Now, however, I find myself pleased with my daring. Daring my finances not to kick me for the purchase, daring my government not to arrest me for it, and daring something bad to happen so that I could extol my wisdom involved with the purchase. The goggles worked well, third and a half generation, they said. Do these salesman dolts know what they are talking about, or like sports announcers, are they just oozing words out of their face for no other reason than that their ears lead to a void? As I said, it works, quietly, very well, and is not supposed to be able to be seen by other units, giving no trace while being able to see some of the other such devices. Ah, but if it could eliminate sound, I would surely have it.
So tell the story again. A group of scribes and Pharisees hatch a hair brained plan to trap Jesus and get rid of him. The plan is to take a female associate before Jesus and pretend to accuse her of adultery to see what He will say. They are all actors playing a part including the woman and Jesus is no dummy. The curtain opens and their performance begins. Jesus just ignores them. In his head he is rolling his eyes and shaking his head and trying not to laugh at how stupid they are and trying not to cry because it’s so obvious they can’t see him for who he is.

I want to finish my novel, but every day a peek at the news goes straight to my inner core with an admonition: ‘Tis no time for vainglorious pursuits; you must give witness, you must protest, though it’s not you who will bear the brunt of the destruction. So I sit down to one of my usual polemics, but then the life of an exile intervenes, and I have to do what life maintenance requires, and the writing has to go into a drawer.

This ship will be turned around by sober thinking South Africans, and I want to be there.

Listening to the fabulous Bangs & a Bun got me thinking, my blog is me, it represents who I am. I feel as though my kids have taken over just a tiny little bit. Yes, I am a parent and I guess that makes me a Parent Blogger…But what about me? Don’t I have an opinion? Likes, dislikes? Not really on my blog it would seem. I was thinking that maybe as the writer of the blog I should get at least some say? Of course the kids are going to feature a lot because they are my life, and I love writing about them, but what about my singing? What about my thoughts and opinions on things? I think I need to bring a bit of ME into The Singing Mummy! So I intend to do just that!

Records from the thirteenth century list a succession of Norman rectors, the first being Robert de Plessis in 1242. The church was beautified with four chantries in the middle ages. These probably lasted until the sixteenth century, when most such institutions disappeared. Beautiful stained glass windows from this era were however part of the church's treasures which survived into the new Protestant regime.

A few years ago, I got my hands on a compact edition of the OED, two very large books that come together in a box with a drawer that holds a magnifying glass so that you can actually read the tiny print. I pull this out when I’m on a word hunt and am feeling like spending a little time with my nose in the book.

“The night your father called on Master von Baren, they were alone in the great hall, and a terrible argument raged between them. Your father left, quite angry, muttering about talking to the King. Shortly after, Master von Baren summoned me to make ready his fastest horse. Said he had some pressing matter to tend to, wouldn’t say what, though.”
The piéce de résistance of my search for early eighties authenticity was dragging the tirelessly good-humoured Belgian Waffling down to the beach in a howling gale so we could enact the time-honoured British Tea Ceremony, Holiday Edition. I think we managed one cup each from the outsize thermos and a scone, crunchy with wind-whipped sand, before the charm wore off, but it evoked the requisite nostalgie de la boue. The only way we could possibly have trumped the experience would have been to drink the tea in the car whilst watching the sea and the lashing rain. But I think you have to be in Filey for it to work properly. I spent several summers as a child on the North East coast, and apparently I used to go swimming quite happily - God knows how I avoided hypothermia.

Here’s a brief synopsis and response to the above video: This one’s got it all. From pineal gland activation to growing your own food and Conan O’Brian. I personally love seeing a video such as this, for it encapsulates so much of the research I have found in scattered corners of the web and synthesizes it into about 19 minutes of positive vibratory knowledge. As for my comments, I have to say, that tidbit about the three littler lemonaders was quite astonishing. Three little girls can’t sell lemonade without a business license? Please, give me a god damn break! Our laws, originally intended to protect freedom, are now robbing us of freedom. Remember, we must not “fight back” in an “us versus them” attempt to restore order through anarchy. You must accept the change with peace and tranquility in your heart. What is particularly interesting about this little “arrest” is that just ten short days ago, our president, Barrack Obama, signed an executive order into law which was some interesting provisions (see link below). Although the bill applies to energy, technology, and production, there is a large portion of this bill which pertains directly to food. With a population growing s rapidly, the food economy is becoming increasingly hard to handle. And, this isn’t because we can’t support that kind of population, it is because the current system of food production needs to be revamped. More people should eat less, more people should begin a sungazing practice, and more people should grow their own food. Those three steps could do wonders for our world. Now, this video calls food additives and quality into question. It says that the government purposefully poisons our food to manipulate our pineal gland. This may seem like a stretch to some, but I wholly agree with this notion. I talked a lot in my previous post about the strength of DMT. Many people report that a DMT experience (whether self-propagated or synthetic) increases intellect, executive control, and openness of mind. It is used freely among South American Shamans. In the Land of the Free, that substance is illegal and could lead to your imprisonment, the ultimate theft of your natural rights. Not to mention the fact that TV, according to the video, also harms the brain. There is no doubt that the media is controlled by the powers that be. Now, evidence shows that the food industry is, too. And, as the video says, these powers are negative beings. They are ego-absorbed and want to harm you. Free yourself! So, to put poisonous additives in food is not a stretch. Truly, there can abolutely zero speculation on the point that there are such poisons in our products. Flouride = rat poison. You brush your teeth with rat poison (unless you have already purchased one of the many excellent flouride free brands!). That is all I have to say for now; I’m outta juice..

As promised, I slept in, though that had more to do with the head cold I'm nursing than any strong political attitude. However, it seems that not everyone had that level of common sense, and most of the staff of the Stranger went to caucuses, in some cases ending up running their precincts and being selected to go to the next level for nomination. Yeah guys, very funny.

Like many other rural towns an evacuee receiving unit was set up in my local church hall. One of the first groups to arrive had with them a baby girl who'd been found lying in a street with no sign of anyone around her. Lots of people volunteered to take the baby home and look after her but the senior ARP officer decided to keep her in the station for a few days so that she could be properly medically examined to ensure she had not been injured in any way. Two night later a forlorn little family came in, cut, bruised, with torn clothes. having been dug out of the rubble. The oldest child was a boy of about nine or ten. Upon hearing the baby crying in another room, he shouted out:
There is so much going on in my head, I don't know what to do with it.

I got it at Target, but they sell them at all stores like that. At least they did before we got the ton of snow. Now they're selling bathing suits and despite the fact that it's below 0 and snowy outside, I can't find a new winter coat for my daughter to save my life.

The best thing about kids Halloween polo shirts is that the child is easily dressed up for the holiday, but doesn’t have to wear an uncomfortable costume that might be tiring for the kid and also be very expensive for you. They are a great solution if you don’t have time to get a costume or if your child is very young or very old. Teenagers also enjoy this.

We like to cook Thai and Chinese food. So tonight we fixed crispy fried eggplant and Hunan tofu. Delicious! We eat two meals a day with a light snack in the afternoon. It is all we need. I'm glad that both of us are on the same page with food--no salt, no meat except seafood, almost no processed food, lots of vegetables. We had arguments for years about food. I was the no salt, no carbs, no meat person and my wife was the meat, salt and pasta person. After her heart attack, things drastically changed in terms of her eating habits. No more arguments about food or booze. What a nice change that is!
I got it so that it would send the ADC value, and display it on my controller, but sending NunChuck packets didn’t work. Packet checks out, but it didn’t seem like the remote ATMega328 actually was processing it? Was it a library conflict? I checked the libraries, and there might be a conflict. The software serial library depends on interrupts to function, and if another interrupt is running, it will block them (such as software servo library, or Servo in Arduino). Another thing I realized more, is that the software serial library can only send or receive, it cannot receive while sending.

Good morning, dear readers! How is Tuesday treating you? As we all know, last month was crazy! Inspiring! Panic inducing! It was the A-Z Challenge. While I didn't post everyday (nor did I get around to half as many new blogs as I wanted) I DID finish my story. Now, I have a new toy to play with :D I knew it was going to be a longer piece when I started the challenge but I wanted to get it out there and see what kind of reaction it received. Judging by your comments, I *need* to write this story! So thank you all for your encouragement and for giving me back my passion for writing. Seriously. I was beginning to wonder if I should change my major to history...again.
I've been a slacker in getting my Activity Day activities posted as of late...my apologies. So while I was putting this one together I thought I would make a better effort of getting a few pictures and getting it posted.

Skinny wifesy has a toothpick dad and a pipe cleaner mom. Never mind that when they got together it probably made the sound of two twigs trying to make a fire, never mind that. The fire was made and skinny wifesy was born. Now when you go to family gatherings at her place, you also have to look at her skinny relatives. The skinny is generations deep. So, why is it that they’re having this “all you can eat” barbecue? To screw with you, why else. Ignore the skinny you’re being surrounded with and suffocated by. Take a swim in the pool. And when her dad says to you, “You don’t move like a big girl,” just say, “Thanks, you don’t move like a midget either.” He is after all 5’3”. When skinny wifesy visits with your parents, you’ll have to deal with the fact that she’s looking at your round mother through one squinty eye. You’ll know she’s thinking, “Is this Christmas future?” Ignore it, because your mother will turn around and lose 75 lbs on her own. She’ll surprise everyone – her doctors, you, skinny-wifesy, and I think – most of all, herself. You’ll always be proud of her for it.

I was extremely nervous on the day of the Marathon. I hadn’t run in 3 weeks thanks to a sprained ankle so I was worried I hadn’t done enough. I was also worried my ankle would be too sore to run on. Turns out I was right to be worried. After just 2 miles my ankle started getting sore so I took a quick waking break. When I started running again I was in too much pain. I ended up walking the rest of the Marathon.
I don’t do a lot of scolding. I don’t call her a naughty girl (unless I’m kidding) and I don’t usually express a lot of anger. If I AM angry, I figure I’m expressing it by the spanking. I know some couples do find that scolding helps, but we choose not to. We talk ahead of time to make sure she’s clear as to why she’s getting spanked because I find she’s often unclear. Sometimes I tell her what I expect of her and why she’s getting this spanking and how I want for things to be different.

Quite apart from Homer’s ageless epic, however, Professor Fone has done a masterful job of fleshing out his characters in all their heroic proportions, as well as their human weaknesses. Agememnon, for example, has been lionized as a king among kings for centuries, and yet his character is far more believable as the self-promoting, glory-seeker by which Fone has depicted him.

In Alice in the Looking Glass there's a joke about Alice seeing "Nobody" on the road, and how good her eyesight must be to be able to see Nobody. The joke ties in perfectly with the Escher pictures where the negative space of one picture becomes something of its own. Is nobody just an absense of something, or is it something in itself? It ties in beautifully with the book Switching on the Night, mentioned above. It also fits with the poem
But Mullah Krekar isn’t the only foreign terrorist living the high life in Norway. Another famous terrorist living in the country is Souhaila Andrawes, who participated in the hijacking of Lufthansa flight 181 in 1977, which resulted in the killing of the German captain. According to passengers that were onboard the plane at the time, Mrs. Andrawes acted very aggressively towards the passengers and she physically assaulted several of them. But the Norwegian authorities took pity on her and gave her a residence permit. Mrs. Andrawes now lives in Oslo.

Later that afternoon, we stopped by Sergio’s home for a tour of his fruit tree orchards and some fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. The entire family was extremely generous and the most gracious of hosts. After such a wonderful visit, we were all a little reluctant to leave. The resourcefulness of these diversified Brazilian cattle operations were very impressive, but the most enjoyable aspect of these two days was the genuine hospitality shown to us. Check back in a couple weeks as we head to Buenos Aires.
There are still five months and change until my debut novel comes out. I have a teleconference scheduled next week with the publicity team at my publisher to discuss…well, I’m not really sure what all is going to be discussed. But I’m greatly looking forward to it and will keep everyone updated on what happens. In other words: things are happening (and will continue to happen) as the date of release approaches. Between now and then I’m going to have to continue focusing on my health but plan to also continue writing/editing and working towards the release in September.
There is one last individual I would like to introduce to your imagination. His name was Glen and he was the home owner/general contractor of the Scottsdale home where I met many of these characters. Glen was the person who had hired us all through CLP to fix up the home which he had just purchased for his family. I got the impression he did not intend for it to be their long-term residence but rather for it to be an investment. Glen had been a working man previously. If I remember correctly he had been a cabinetmaker earlier in his life, but he had definitely moved into the white-collar world by the time I met him. To clarify, I do not mean to imply that “white-collar” is a bad thing, I only want to point out that Glen had transitioned from one to the other. Glen was not at ease. He was feeling the stress of his investment and counting the dollars as each day passed with him paying the salary of anywhere from 5 to 10 individuals. He also seemed to have a condescending view towards those of us who obviously couldn’t afford to drive Mercedes SUVs or even to provide ourselves with decent housing. He wasn’t openly haughty, just unconsciously superior. At one point he discovered that I had a college degree and his attitude towards me changed for the better. I found this to be true on a number of occasions while I worked for CLP. When it was discovered that I had gone to college I was treated with more respect and consideration, whether or not I had yet proved myself to be worthy of it. Like the rest of the people I have described in this short series, Glen passed from my life as quickly as he came into it. We finished the job. His family moved in. I helped him carry in one of their couches without charging him for it (which was hard for him to believe), and we parted ways forever.

In amongst the boiler-plate sociological techniques suggested are some workshop exercises where staff are brought together and subjected to variants of the discredited and unethical Delphi Technique. There is a gratuitous graphic of 'social influencers on children', a handy decision tree about factors in human behaviour and potential tools to change it toward desired ends including naming and shaming, limiting access, automatic enrolment, taxes, regulation, forced choice and fines. These people are sick, and they are making other people sick with their vile indoctrination.
At first I thought having to get the day started at 9 am was too early but after seeing the time it takes to work on hair, make-up, and get everyone going I was totally wrong. It was organized chaos all day. Everyone kept asking if I was ok. I was calm, chatty but not overly talkative. At one point my make-up girl said I was making her nervous because I was so calm.

We are sponsoring Bryson's uncle who is on parole. Ironically he used to be our drug dealer and literal partner in crime. When we got arrested and started working our way back out of the hell hole we created, he continued on the wrong path and wasn't so lucky to get probation. He got out over a year ago but still hadn't learned and went right back to selling dope and violated parole in the halfway house. This time he has made it through a more intensive inmate rehabilitation program than he had to. He finished his time in the halfway house and now he needs somewhere to live. The sad reality and irony is that there are no other family members that are clean and can promise to provide a home free from weapons and drugs, but we can.

That is all well and good, but what are the best sources of fish oil? Consuming large quantities of fish would be the logical choice, but knowing that many species contain high levels of mercury, doing so might actually cause further damage to the brain. For this reason, Omega-3 supplements are probably the best way to keep the body well-stocked with EPA and DHA.
Discipline and control have always been my biggest challenges, and when the reserved and soft-spoken tell me they admire how I express myself, I tell them how I admire them, able to be calm, able to be quiet. I have to work hard at neatness of all kinds – in my house, in my communication, in my appearance, and in my demeanor.
It is clear to see, after reading the information above that removing adipose tissue from around the abdominal region is something of the utmost importance. With an increase of weight issues for many and an increase in both childhood and adulthood obesity, the lethal nature of visceral fat is a worry. Two things which can, and must be done are control of fat in our diet and an exercise routine which helps burn the fatty tissue and develop strong abdominal muscles, with higher calorie demand. If muscles grow in size then they have a higher resting calorie demand than muscle with a smaller overall mass, which means you will burn more calories at rest and therefore burn more fatty tissue.
Afterwards we hosed ourselves off and got changed. We hung around for a while listening to the music and taking in the moment… mostly just not wanting to move. I planned on staying for the after party but we were all so unbelievably dog tired that we decided to head into town for an extremely well deserved dinner and then head home. We went to the nicest place we could find, which was some sit down steak house filled with middle aged people wearing khakis and dresses. We had mud stained shirts on, probably smelled horribly, I had a mohawk and all of us had skin dyed some sort of color from the Chernobyl Jacuzzi. We met some very nice locals while waiting for our seats and talked to them about Tough Mudder and they were all incredibly impressed and enthused. Some woman even gave us 40 dollars to split between the 4 of us, we told her she didn’t have to but she said she wanted to. All of us had massive steaks. 3 of us had 20 oz. ribeyes. We ate like kings.

I started the wide receiving core you see above and benched Brent Celek and Laurent Robinson. I originally had Celek in for Brandon Lloyd; however, I changed that decision a few hours ago when I read that Bradford has a better than 50% chance to start. Again, Brandon is a risky start given the St. Louis QB situation and Seattle's recent defensive dominance; however, I think Brandon has a chance to score more points than Celek. Refer to Part 1 of my fantasy football post to see why I am benching Laurent Robinson.
“Very well,” I said. “Bring me your phone and I will scrutinise the photos before deleting them myself.

Born October 15, 1992, Sam Twiston-Davies was still studying for AS-level exams at school in Gloucestershire, when he had his first Cheltenham Festival winner and Grand National ride as one of racing’s most accomplished amateur riders. The son of trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies and his estranged wife, Cathy, (who both rode as amateurs), Sam was successful in pony racing before starting in point-to-points in the 2008/09 season when becoming eligible at the age of 16. Within a few weeks, on December 28, 2008, he rode his first winner between the flags, taking a race at Cottenham in Cambridgeshire on Grenfell, trained by his mother. At Ludlow on February 18, 2009, he scored his first success under Rules when partnering Baby Run, owned and trained by Nigel, to victory in a hunter chase. A career that was bound to flourish gained added lift through Baby Run, for he and Sam went on to finish third in the following month’s Christie’s Foxhunter Chase at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival and later gained one of the season’s biggest prizes when teaming up for victory in the Champion Hunters’ Chase at the Punchestown Festival. They capped that in March, 2010, when returning to Cheltenham and running out easy winners of the Christie’s Foxhunter Chase. Sam then went to Aintree and partnered Hello Bud into fifth on his John Smith’s Grand National debut. He turned professional shortly afterwards. Sam has a younger brother, 17-year-old Willy, who took over on Baby Run in the 2011 Christie’s Foxhunter Chase, only to be unseated when leading at the second-last fence although he landed the John Smith’s Fox Hunters’ Chase on the horse a few weeks later. Sam partnered Hello Bud to victory in the 2010 Becher Chase over the Grand National course at Aintree in November and that same month gave Little Josh a brilliant ride to land the Grade Three Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham. He writes a weekly column in the Racing Post every Monday. John Smith’s Grand National record: 2010 Hello Bud (5th); 2011 Hello Bud (PU 29th)

It would be nice to think poetry for a while, to breathe the emptier spaces of the page and move to a rhythm that generated itself as it progressed, to feel the slight drunkenness of careering through the forest of words powered by curiosity and the faint scent of subject. And then the white of the unwritten page breathing like the memory of nothing. A film.
Hello everyone, I am EXO-K’s KkamJong, Kai!
This past Shabbat, I ate the most delicious Asian-style noodle salad I’ve eaten in a long time. My sister-in-law Brynn had added her own twist to an Asian recipe by adding, of all things, tehina, to the sauce. It’s a combination that really works and gives the salad a wonderful depth. I suppose if you don’t want to use the tehina or can’t be bothered to make it, then you can use about 4 tablespoons of peanut butter instead. But I highly recommend this version, which I have dubbed East Meets East Noodle Salad, as it brings together ingredients from the Far and Middle East into one dish.

They have no doubt done the calculations and worked out that they could recoup their initial investment by buying £1000 worth of beer off the BrewDog website, or two grands worth over the counter in their bars. For some, that will look quite an attractive proposition. Indeed, I know one of the original shareholders who parted with £230 in the first Equity share release just under two years ago and he has recouped his original investment in discount obtained from purchases off the website. He had to keep buying, though, but he says that he would have bought the beers anyway.

Delightful though the story of Pinocchio is, it does raise a serious question. Does the fantasy of creating a child through magic suggest that humans have some deep dissatisfaction with the fruit of their own seed? I sense that many human parents expect their children to appreciate them as their benefactors. If so, they expect too much. No infant will ever accept that it is indebted to anyone for the pure fact of its existence, or even for the sustenance it requires in its early years. A mother may describe the trials of her labour in excruciating detail to her child, but the most likely response she will get is a rather bored resentment. The child, after all, did not ask to be born.
It is of course a brilliant conceit that this is a silent movie dramatising the demise of the silent era. And the fact that it has captivated audiences the world over adds a beautiful irony to the whole endeavour. But perhaps its most enchanting quality is that it tells a complex story in its most simplistic form — thus recreating the innocence of an era when audiences didn't need loads of hi-tech bells and whistles to appreciate the magic of cinematic story-telling. How cool is that, to be able to enjoy a movie as if you've never seen one before?

Dusty, two-lane highways are quintessential to the American way. Up until this past weekend, I hadn't really experienced the meaning of a "road trip". Sure, I drove to campus when I was in undergrad, but that was just me traveling from Point A to Point B, several times per year. I wasn't taking stops every hour or so to take in the scenery. Then again, I was the driver.

So, anyway, you probably know that there are two bosses: Scarlion and Targa. There are 3 phases to each and they have different stats from GMS, obviously:
So in all honesty there are some things I can’t explain to you entirely and will never be able to explain to you entirely but thats because it wasn’t ever something I was supposed to be able to explain to begin with. Everything in the bible is written down for a reason and is God breathed and God inspired. That being said there is still a good portion of it that either isn’t readily comprehensible by simply skimming through it and has to be thoroughly studied. Either that or it simply doesn’t make sense to us yet because God hasn’t revealed it to us. I recently spoke with a man who has been reading the bible in depth and studying it thoroughly for the past 50 years of his life and there are things in there that he is only just now beginning to understand. I can understand your frustration with the pi situation in kings. I found this link helpful in better understanding not only the nature of the verse in kings but also of pi in general. Very informative to say the least. Personally I’d like to understand why mark included this passage in Mark 14:51, when Jesus was being captured in the garden of Gethsemane right before being crucified. “A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.”…It confused me. Anyways, most of the stuff you mentioned in the old testament through was meant to be read literally and in full context. Well here’s the link to the pi explanation:

She’s got freedom in the 21st century. Funny how I don’t necessarily get song lyrics until after somebody spells them out for me, what they mean. I thought “freedom at 21″ meant one thing until a reviewer pointed out it was about a blackberry-obsessed woman who doesn’t give a rat’s ass about the effect she has on people, and that slapped the whole thing into a new perspective for me. So then I went to look up the lyrics, and the subject of the song went from being someone admirable to someone despicable.
I was so sad. I was sad about Gideon (of course). I was sad that I had to go through all this. I was sad about everything. I was almost just plain mad. I hate it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to go through this. I pray (nearly everyday) what Jesus prayed in the garden, "...O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." Matthew 26:39. That verse says everything that I want to say: "God: I don't want to do this. But at the same time, I know that you have a plan, and I want to be a part of Your plan, and I will do it if it will accomplish something that will glorify You." I am so thankful that Jesus saw it fit to pray that way, because it's perfect for me and Gideon.

How's everyone today? Well, I do believe it has turned back to Winter. It has been a very gray day here. Cloudy and rainy from morning to night. The kind of day you want to stay inside and read a book, have a cup of tea and just relax. We had planned to be outside, but ended up inside when we were here. We started out being a bit lazy...there was another one of those wee hour thunderstorms that wakes me up and I couldn't go back to sleep. So, after roaming around the house at 2 am, I ended up staying in bed until after 7. Believe me, I hardly ever do that.

Oh, and there is another scare tactic being used: The ration of workers to retirees. Over the next decades, the number of workers compared to the number of retirees is predicted to shrink - that is, there will be fewer workers to support retirees. That, we're told in the darkest tones possible, will bring an intolerable burden on "ordinary wage earners" and thus the economy.

To add insult to injury, (and what does that mean in this context?), we went out to dinner again tonight. We ate at the Fairmont Princess La Hacienda. And, just like last night, I ate more than I needed to. More than I should have. Oh, woe is me. The food was very good. We had guacamole, chips, and shrimp ceviche to start. Then I had wonderful crab enchiladas with yummy black beans and rice. And, oh yeah, here comes the dessert! Cinnamon churros with three perfectly scrumptious and fat-laden dipping sauces. The only good thing is that Gary shared the dessert this time. Oh, I forgot to mention the two Margaritas I had--no calories there, right? You know, some people actually don't figure in the calories from alcohol. But they are there, believe me. And they are empty calories.

Fish, rice and veggies. I’d love to tell you all kinds of wonderful things about fish and omegas and proteins and stuff. But I can not. I am not a dietician. What I do know is that per 100g there is usually less than 100 calories in fish. If you make 1 cup of minute rice (dry) and eat the whole thing that is about 300 calories and veggies while filling and healthy have very few calories, especially carrots it seems. Oddly enough there is milk in the picture, I usually have Coke Zero. On the plate there is maybe 400 Calories.

I wanted a quick and easy dinner to make last night and this was just perfect. It's pretty simple - slice up some of your favorite veggies (I used green peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli, and a few pressed garlic cloves) and saute them in olive oil. While those are cooking, open a box of frozen perogies and saute them in another pan until they are lightly browned, about 8-10 minutes. Heat up some sausage (I used Bob Evan's fully cooked links) and toss everything together.
They are tasty, salty and have a smooth texture – you can’t usually stop at one. They are so easy to munch on and before you know it – BAM there goes the bag.

South Africa continues to grapple with corruption, growing social and economic inequalities, and the weakening of state institutions by partisan appointments and one-party dominance. Attacks on freedom of expression, particularly attempts by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to tamper with media independence, raised serious concerns about the government’s commitment to the protection of basic civil and political rights. In April 2011, images of the brutal, public murder by the police of Andries Tatane during a peaceful protest in Ficksburg to demand better service delivery elicited public ire regarding police brutality. Despite these concerns, institutions of democracy, among them the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector, remain highly active.

The picture below is from a Perfection Milker ad that appeared in the Minneapolis Tribune on October 8, 1922. The company had an exhibit at the National Dairy Show, Minnesota State Fair Grounds, October 7th to 14th. The ad said to be sure to visit the exhibit "whether you are in the market this year or not." The milker was said to save time and increase profits:

Anyhow – this Sunday I went to go see the local minor league game at a real life baseball stadium. I apologize if I am using terms incorrectly. It should be clear by now that I have no idea what I’m talking about when it comes to sporting events. All I knew, was that I wanted a hot dog and a beer – and I wanted to sit down, eat my hot dog and drink my beer while there was baseball being played. Easy enough.
Everything I know I’ve been given
噂のアナトリアにやっと行きました！友人のニッキーが紹介してくれ、ランチをして来ました。美味しかったです！写真で見てお分かりかもしれませんが、前菜をいくつか頼み、２人（娘も入れたら３人）で分けました。美味しくて、量もランチにはちょうど良かったですよ。なんとも言えないエギゾチックな雰囲気がとても素敵なレストランでした！是非お試しあれ。
Come and look me in the eye and tell me this isn't a cool cover. I dare you. Ack-Ack Macaque has to be one of the oddest titles to come from genre publishers this year. To date Gareth L. Powell has published one novel with The Recollection and also the novella Silversands. Both are far-future Sci-Fi that most would put in the Space Opera camp. So Ack-Ack Macaque is definitely a step in a new direction for him, but the story does have its roots in one of his short stories of the same name published in 2007. With a cover like this it would be criminal of me not to read it. It has got a smoking money on it for book's sake! Here's the blurb:
Any writer can tell you that life isn’t fair. It ain't. But every so often, for no perceptible reason, life gets it exactly right.
Cheapness of production and distribution is the source of success in economic life, and therefore in civilization. Centralization probably is proportionate to velocity, and the most vertiginous nation triumphs over its neighbors. These contentions are sustained by an examination of Syrian, Persian, Hellenic, Roman, Central Asian, Flemish, Spanish, and Russian civilizations.

The series The War You Don’t See uses the same hand-crafted photomontage technique as Heartfield. In some the very “crudity” of this approach – one now unfamiliar to younger artists used to slick digital image manipulation – adds visual punch to the message and implies a critical attitude to expensive electronic media.
Death does not have the final victory! “Thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 15:57)
And that’s just one of my books. When I consider all of them, my gratitude is unending. I am grateful I never had to twice attend my mother’s funeral as poor Bob Stark did in More Deaths Than One. I’m grateful I have not yet had to deal with an epidemic so severe that the entire state of Colorado needs to be quarantined as described in A Spark of Heavenly Fire. I am grateful that I am not being held captive in an underground installation run by a quasi-government agency as are my heroes in Light Bringer, which will be released in the spring of 2010.
It is important for people to understand the actual significance of President Obama’s highly publicized, surprise visit to Afghanistan. This trip had nothing to do with the outcome of the war itself and everything to do with domestic political consumption. It was designed to win votes from a war-weary public.
I really enjoyed this layout so much I pulled it out and played with it again adding some of my favorite images of MGM (now known as Disney Hollywood Studios). Sorry folks at Disney, it will always be MGM to me, lol. I just can't get used to the new name.

Villages/towns of Caesarea Philippi: Apparently Jesus and the disciples went not to the Hellenized Caesarea itself, but to the “suburbs” of that city, the villages nearby which it controlled. The idea is presumably, as in Mark 9:30-31, to isolate themselves for intense teaching.

Hey Bloggers,
Every problem is solvable all you have to do is put one step in front of the other and walk a little a day. The steps accumulate and after a week you’re a different person than when you first started out. You got relationship problems, find out the extent of the problem, research and study for solutions and attack the problem a little at a time. Asking for help is OK trust me.
I think of my mainstream Protestant denomination—they appear to be doing all of the above, and yet it isn’t growing in membership. Committees gathered around conference tables, brainstorming how to make the church grow—to engage people, etc.,—have not found the “trick” to welcome, encourage, offer, help, and commit to the generation represented by my children and their children.
Well, you have a great argument there, self-doubting part of my brain, but I spent some time watching YouTube videos of adult gymnasts the other day, and I have rarely been more inspired. I saw a 41-year-old doing level 7/8 tumbling (that’s 7/8 out of 10, so, pretty darn good). I saw a 23-year-old who hadn’t trained since she was 11 doing level 10 beam work. I saw a 31-year-old who had never taken gymnastics before progress from barely being able to do a forward roll to doing cartwheels on the beam. All of the videos were impressive, and they gave me some significant information.
I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
I didn’t actually think that all of those clips would remain in her hair for more than a few minutes, but many hours later they were all still adorning the front of Saarah’s hair(she didn’t get them anywhere on the back 85% of her head).

I dressed, did my hair and makeup (and learned at the end of the night that I can no longer wear under eye concealer and powder – my under eye area looked like the Sahara desert by the time I took off my makeup), got dressed, coordinated jewelry, chose a jacket, swapped purses and headed out. I got to the restaurant a full 30 minutes early.
The low fat diet so often prescribed by medical professionals and nutrition experts has caused a critical deficiency of healthy fats necessary for the development of the human brain from infancy to adulthood. In addition to the extensive library of research showing the effectiveness of Omega-3 fats in cardiovascular health and cognition, new evidence documents the need for this essential nutrient through all stages of life to improve self-esteem and to prevent depression. Health-minded people will want to supplement with 2.5 grams of combined EPA/DHA to naturally protect against behavior disorders and depression.

Night came, the drizzling dissipated and I cracked open the slider, allowing in cold night air. The living room was dark except for a Diptyque Baies candle dancing shadows on the wall. I poured myself a glass of dark red Zinfandel and sunk into my leather armchair.
‘That’s right. Up there.’ Petro paused again, expectantly.
Although we are now old fogies, Mrs. Random and I both own cell phones (mobile phones). However, mobile phones don’t work on our five acres. They don’t work because there are not enough cell phone towers on our part of the island. There are not enough cell phone towers because people who want to preserve nature would rather look at hills covered with fir trees than at cell phone towers. The cell phone companies build towers to look like hills, but the preservationistd are not happy with imitation hills.
Very good today and felt full all day. Lunch was tricky as I went out to celebrate a milestone with colleagues. I ate before we went (well, more grazed on nuts all morning) so only had tea, but it wasn’t unpleasant. People were supportive and asking all about the cleanse. We then had cake back at the office, but I did not have a piece.
I know what you’re wondering–what’s wrong with canning, or drying or freezing? The answer is absolutely nothing. Sure, some processes alter the nature of the food by default but that’s isn’t the problem in mass produced processed foods. Mass produced foods have a host of additives to make sure the product makes it from the plant or factory to your plate at home. More often than not these foods make that journey safely: about 90 percent of the foods we consume are processed.

The danger of jilted humans seeking revenge on their jilters has been recognised by Facebook, which has banned naked photos from its network. Also banned are pictures of urine, vomit, semen and ear wax. I think they’ve gone too far with ear wax. No one should be ashamed about what comes out of their ears, which is difficult to distinguish from guacamole in any case.
4) Invent role-playing games that allow you to doze while playing.

He falls for it every time. Ha!

"Well 'kinky' is less judgmental." We both smiled. Still playing the word games, both of us. "So, neither of you ever wanted anything... unusual. Until, perhaps, he started getting ideas from elsewhere?" I suggested. "Like, maybe from magazines, and who knows what -- or who -- else?"

This skirt was one of last year's most-worn items. I didn't tally its wearings, but it seems to have been worn a lot in my memory. And no surprise really, as it's black and white and doesn't need ironing, or even to be on a hanger. It does, however, have some not-amazing memories to go with it. Today I even considered putting it in my giveaway pile. We'll see.
This situation typically arises when the product has existed for some time in the marketplace, but is not doing as well as it should. Marketers don’t really understand what task this product is being used for and which other tasks could be connected with the product. In this situation some key customers should be tracked down (for example those who have recently increased purchase significantly, bought the product at some inconvenience or have stopped buying) and investigated through ethnography based market research tools.
In anticipation of the upcoming holidays (yes, sigh, I did see Christmas decor displayed at the store already!), I'll be posting gift ideas...math games and activities that feel like way too much fun to contain real learning! (Heh heh...what the kiddos don't know won't hurt 'em...and might just educate 'em!)
Your passions may not look like anyone else’s. They may not be understandable or relevant to anyone but you. They may not be “important” or profitable, or marketable. They may reveal themselves to you slowly, like one of those pills you put in water that take forever to expand into Christmas tree. It may take some prodding, and some additional hot water. You may have to put up with patronizing, doubtful people who wish they had to courage to pursue passions of their own.
Maki takes a job at a small company that gives tourists hour-long joy rides on a Cessna. It’s not like piloting fighter jets. But the steady hours mean he gets more time to be near his son. On his first day a strange woman in black, Sara, signs up for a ride and holds Maki at gunpoint, ordering him to fly far off his usual course. The mysterious hijacker takes him to a secret military base where Maki is quarantined in a huge concrete reinforced bunker. His demands to know why are met with stoic silence. Finally, once Maki is securely locked into the bunker’s basement under guard and unable to escape, he is told the answer.

If your pastor is in the transitional phase of crossing over into the “word of faith” or “prosperity gospel” movements, you may want to consider getting him a notebook for his birthday or pastor appreciation day. I know that does not sound like a very special gift, but it can come in really handy. Just make sure it is fairly thick. He’s going need it to be able to write down and keep up with all his different “anointings.”

‘What is your favorite drink, Mom?’ Ryan asked me as our car passed by a liquor store. ‘I love mango Lassi, what’s yours Ryan?’ I asked politely since I knew he was bursting at the seams to tell me.
H.R. Giger is in my opinion, a mad genius. I own a couple of his "coffee table" art books, and they are scary stuff. I own Biomechanics, H.R. Giger's Alien, and his Necronomicon. In reading about him, I discovered that within his lifetime he has rubbed elbows with just about every major artist in the world including Ridley Scott and Salvatore Dali. He's had a girlfriend that committed suicide, is the atypical primadonna with huge demands and uncompromising work ethic, and is notoriously difficult to work with.

This might sound mababaw but despite my ‘blowing’ figure, I love ICE CREAM just like anyone else. Granted that I haven’t tasted Haagen Daas as well as other Western-branded Ice Cream, the Ice cream brands I eat in my everyday life is usually Selecta, Magnolia, Nestle, and Binggrae. I prefer Magnolia and Binggrae better because the price are reasonable and you really get your money’s worth. Nagsawa na ako sa Selecta Ice Cream stick kasi yun at yun na lang ang flavor, kaya nag-go ako sa Magnolia Ice Cream Stick, andun pa ang favorite flavor kong bubblegum at strawberry (under Magnolia Fun Bar) and Sweet Corn (Pinipig Crunch). I enjoy Magnolia the same way I enjoy Binggrae. In fairness, I enjoy Selecta Pinoy Sorbetes stick in UBE and KESO. Same creaminess at 5 bucks.
Public radio’s popular This American Life episode about abuses in the Foxconn factories…has been retracted on the grounds of… “significant fabrications”…When you read something bad about a Foxconn factory and then see that thousands of people line up for the chance of a job at one of them, that really ought to make you wonder. What were those guys doing the day before they decided to stand in line?…
John DeWolfe isn't the first person you would think of when you hear the word 'ringer'. I mean, for most of his professional life he was a respected literature and poetry critic--not exactly a Fox Mulder, you understand? But in order to make ends meet, DeWolfe has in recent times taken up a new profession: writer of lurid tabloid paperback books about such subjects as UFO's, satanic cults, and unexplained phenomenon. So while he's no Fox Mulder, he is a poor man's Kolchak (who was Mulder's spiritual godfather anyway), and the Dynamic Duo team up to solve this Merry Mystery.

It will be wasted breath because most people, reasonably enough, want to see that there’s a life worth living on the other side of the changes your activist movement wants to make, and the best way to give them a glimpse of that life is to enact it yourself. It will also be wasted breath because most people have a tolerably good nose for hypocrisy, and are highly familiar with the kind of demagogy that calls on everybody else to make sacrifices and get by with less so the demagogue doesn’t have to do so. Talk to Americans who didn’t support either the climate change movement or its corporate opposition, and you’ll find that for a good many of them, it was when word of Al Gore’s air-conditioned mansion and frequent-flyer miles got around that they decided that global warming was yet another manufactured threat, meant to stampede people into acquiescing with somebody’s political agenda.

John Mayer, Eternal Wiener King, creates a rather 'meta' moment by talking about his relationship with his own personal wiener.
As a result of taking down Cecilia, however, Ichika gains yet another girl who takes an interest in him much to Houki’s annoyance since she’s clearly never stopped thinking about him. Then a new transfer student from China arrives, she is Rin Fan who also happens to be a childhood friend since their junior high days. Rin also happens to be in love with Ichika and that fact is obvious from the minute she greets him. However, Rin is rather upset that a totally oblivious Ichika didn’t get the meaning behind a promise he made her a long time ago. As a result, they battle it out using there is when an unidentified rogue IS appears and both Rin and Ichika must work together to stop it.
Mastermind Jr. Emma is really good at this game. So good that we are thinking of switching to the regular version very soon.
Here I sit, in the quiet calm of my kitchen. Lights dimmed, candle burning, wine to sip and my friend, Laptop. I have just put the boys to bed after visiting the neighborhood bonfire. The boys had a blast playing with all the neighbor kids and I got to involve myself in adult conversation and soak in the warmth of the fire combined with the chill in the air. Perfect bonfire weather, I think.
Google Drive was released yesterday, and I clicked the button on the website letting Google know I was interested in their product. I received an email late last night informing me that my Google Drive was ready. This morning, on a lark really, I went to the Google Drive website and clicked on the download link for the sync application to add to my work iMac. I downloaded the DMG fie without a problem and opened it up. I copied the Google Drive app to my Applications folder, like you are supposed to with Macintosh, and then I sat back and marveled at it. Google Drive, finally.
I met western suburbs food blogger Kenny from consider the sauce and we both discussed the disappointing food scene in williamstown and Jill was super friendly and within minutes of me arriving allowed me to use her towel to clean my grease stained fingers from fixing my bike chain. I also learnt about the use of coconut powder in making ice cream from essjayeats and I had fun catching up with those already familar to me like Cindy and Michael from wheres the beef, Johanna from Green Gourmet Giraffe and Lisa Dempster. I didn't get a chance to have a proper chat with Ed from Tomato, Carla from Easy as Vegan Pie or Claire from Melbourne Gastronome but I did enjoy playing a few games with Claire's bocce set. These was so much yummy food, highlights included Jill's refreshing watermelon salad, Michael's caeser salad, Carla's risotto balls and both Johanna and Lisa's chocolate desserts. The picnic was lots of fun and left me filling super full and sluggish as all good potlucks show. It was also a great example of what a community building activity blogging can be and for once Melbourne behaved and gave us a nice summer day.

Taking indoor photos continues to prove challenging, to say the least! Pulling my hair out a little while getting acquainted with my Nikon D3000 and figuring out what aperture to use and blah, blah, bah humbug! Tis not the season to be wrestling with a new camera.

Overall I found the film average. I will watch again, I will enjoy Depp’s performance for what it is (and enjoy Chloë Grace Moretz stealing her scenes), I will chuckle at the genuinely amusing moments and I will enjoy the obvious style but I will mourn the lack of story and absence of substance.
Now this is the way to start off a Monday morning! My friend, Angie Mizzell, received the Versatile Blogger Award – for good reason – and has passed on a nomination to me. And I never win anything – ever!

While I completely understand that there is a need to balance the budget and restore some level of rationality to the decision to attend university, hurting students in the pocket is the worst thing that National could possibly do. I don’t care about interest on student loans – that’d be a good idea – but lowering my income when the cost of living is ridiculously out of touch with household incomes is sadistic.

Thank you for being a friend
Now that the election has passed and the Government shows no signs of crumbling apart quite yet, I feel that I can come clean and admit that I have voted Conservative all of my life. So my bias is clear. What I've discovered since joining the EDL is that this doesn't matter. All are truly welcome here. Through the EDL I've come to question some of the assumptions that I have may have made about certain groups of people, and perhaps tackle some of my prejudices. I've spoken to trade unionists, committed socialists, and all manner people from different political and social backgrounds; people, I'm sorry to admit, I've often held a dim view of in the past.
Some context might be needed here. When the big break began, I found myself unable to concentrate on my work. I thought it was probably temporary and subsequently spent two years not being able to focus. I could produce a semblance of work, so my lack of focus wasn’t noticeable, but I could feel it. And the further I got into graduate studies, the more I found myself unable to focus on my tasks. Professors who read my prose could tell that I had good ideas but wasn’t able to express them. Since writing had always been somewhat natural to me (in fact, the only activity that gave me any modicum of self-esteem), this was especially difficult. Plus, I was in the English field, where writing is a necessary skill.

Yes, I most definitely realize that unschoolers are not all anarchists. Most aren't (though there are definitely more anarchists in your average group of unschoolers than you'd find in your average group of random people). I just find that, from my point of view, the two philosophies are extremely complementary. Both emphasize living in co-operation, living in freedom. Both involve a lack of dependence on the State or other higher authorities.

Therefore, in my opinion, anyone can write a good blog post. What you want to say is right there, at your fingertips. Show the world you're not afraid of the blogging police and make your blog stand out. If you want to follow blogging etiquette then do; but remember that if you don't, your blog is still as good as everyone else's. Because you're out there, doing what you feel is right and not what others feel is wrong.

‘”…the Lord will give you understanding in everything.’” Then why hasn’t he given it to everyone at the start of the human race so that NO ONE would ever have to be damned to eternal damnation? Having nonsensical and conflicting things in a book that was meant to be taken as literal and as the infallible word of some deity is going to make people not believe in it, especially those who have some sense about them.

Judgments can be so cruel and they stick around for a long time it seems...probably because they turn into fun stories to tell others I suppose...and then the vicious cycle continues.

Another good book in the Luxe series. It doesn’t matter about reading the first book that much about from Elizabeth’s death. I think Godberson could have not described the characters again but it was a good reminder. The ending is very dramatic like the last one. It is very surprising so watch out for that one. Can’t wait for the next one, Envy.
As I’ve gotten older I have started to understand the temptations of food a little more, but not to the extremes that some people take it. I don’t know if you’ve ever listened to The Splendid Table, but that woman talks about food like a registered sex offender talks about sixteen year olds. I once had a child in my car and they heard her talking about an egg she ate in France and I had to turn off the radio because I worried that it was doing psychological damage. She once had a twenty minute conversation with someone about the impact different types of bread have had on her life. While undoubtedly important, I rarely ever reflect back on the breads in my life when I’m not already eating a piece. It’s absolutely ridiculous. The food television networks are better but I’ll still occasionally get the impression that the food is supposed to deliver some sort of higher pleasure to the person consuming it than it should. It’s usually when they strategically light the food to look good and then shoot it with a soft filter like it’s in some sex scene on an vintage soap opera that I’ll start to feel like something is amiss.
A hippie mama (in my mind) spends time with her child picking wildflowers and composing music to the beat of the bongos. Mostly I watch tv with my kids. Only educational tv though. Well. Mostly. But I have discovered a few cheap, easy ways to make a bit of an effort toward saving the earth, protecting animals, promoting family time, etc. And, let’s face it, if we all made just a bit of an effort, wouldn’t it make a huge difference?

I suppose you could read the poem on the page. It’s a pretty bad poem, full of awkward phrases. I regret even writing it on the page now, but it’s done in paint and there’s no going back. The ending is the worst. I think I was too tired to make a coherent ending. It was written for a creative writing class, and it was sort of inspired (well now I think a lot of the page is inspired) by Jean Micheal Basquiat. http://basquiat.com/ Except Basquiat could draw crazy words everywhere and it would make sense. I just made a mess except with numbers and calculus.
Good Morning all my scrappy, crafty friends! My niece is going to be having baby number two, early in November. New mom's are soooo busy, it's hard for them to find the time to scrapbook those first moments, so I made her a two page layout for the new baby's scrapbook.

Perhaps it’s in my blood, passed from father to son, generation to generation, down through the ages. As an island we have been conquered many times and always by sea, by seafaring people like the Vikings. But, if this is the reason, why don’t I get on a ship and spend my free time crossing our oceans and seas? In reality, I have little desire for anything more than an occasional boat trip around our shores, anything further I find boring and judging by the amount of entertainment provided on cruise ships, the majority would agree with me.

So I found a recipe online, and we made up our super duper sugar syrup. We put 2 cups of water on to boil, and gradually mixed in 4 cups of sugar. Yes, you read that right. Twice as much sugar as water. Oh, and some blue food coloring.

This cake is more like a sweet bread or muffin than a cake, not overly sweet. So serve it with honey butter, crème fraîche, or a tall glass of milk, almond is my favorite.
Statistics compiled by Environment Canada show that greenhouse gas pollution from oilsands companies, which require an energy-intensive production process, have jumped 300 per cent since 1990, exceeding those of all cars on Canadian roads, not including light-duty trucks, and cancelling out reductions in emissions from other sectors. The latest federal data also shows that the oilsands producers are no longer reducing the pollution per barrel of oil produced, contradicting claims made in a separate industry-sponsored marketing campaign.

Jennifer Connelly stars as a young girl who arrives at an eerie Swiss boarding school where the students are being butchered by a vicious serial killer. With the help of a wheelchair-bound scientist (played by Donald Pleasence) she discovers she has special powers (she can psychicly communicate to insects), and uses them to pursue the killer before she becomes the next victim.
On Saturday, I had some over-ripened bananas around. Because I was stuck at home waiting for the man who was going to power wash my house to show up, I decided I would make banana bread. I searched through many cookbooks and decided on Paula Deen’s recipe from her Southern Cooking Bible. I did make one slight change to her banana bread recipe though. I replaced the 3/4 cup chopped walnuts with 3/4 cup coconut. It is the most delicious bread I have ever made. The edges of the bread are the best part because they are crunchy and soooo scrumptious.

The Best Digital SLRs We’ve Tested – If you’ve outgrown your point-and-shoot camera, the next logical step is an interchangeable lens model.

straightforward, and I was impressed by the user-friendly set-up Lulu operates. I did hit a couple of problems, but these were mainly due to me trying to avoid anything that would howl “Self-Published!” at anybody who picked up the book.

In the world of today speaking the truth is a revolutionary act. Not just speaking the truth about politics but about Jesus as well. Even in most churches now days the truth is very taboo. Tradition is held as an act of worship, even when the tradition is wrong and goes against the teachings of the bible. Speaking the truth and standing for God means being persecuted, hated, and abused even by church people clinging to the wicked traditions of man. I have lost many people I believed were friends for my stance for the truth. I have made people angry enough to try to fight me. They find out that I will not fight back, so they do not physically hurt me, they just harass me.
So, you may be asking yourself, what does the next week bring for me? So, I would answer you, a shit ton of stuff. Oral Spanish interview in the morning, working in the Alumni office later on to help with pre-graduation stuff, and Potter’s House with the Authentic Ministries crew tonight. A barbecue at the Drury Ambassador advisor’s house on Thursday, and another barbecue with Authentic on Sunday. A computer science program due Friday that I haven’t started yet, and two labs that were started in March but were never finished (with good reason). Cleaning the bathroom Saturday. Mounting my photographs on boards (and first buying said boards). FINALS (one on Tuesday, + a paper being due, and one on Wednesday). I’m going home WEDNESDAY! Packing. Gotta do that Monday, I suppose. My mom is coming around 3 on Wednesday and I have to check out by 4:30. So this should be fun.
Bhumika Patel explains “Sita in the Ramayana: Female Empowerment Through Trial by Fire” with a mature flourish that presided throughout her entire presentation. I was almost inspired to change my major. Though she starts off with a few…technical glitches, Bhumika manages to bravely carry on her presentation, speaking from a womanist, feminist perspective about the story of the “Ramayana”, a Sanskrit epic poem which has “stuck with her over the years”. This particular story represents the ideal man and woman for many people in South Asia. Bhumika explains that she wanted us, as her audience, to understand how woman can become inspired through this entirely patriarchal story.

It was as I filled the bins with water for the first time that I recalled some amazing olives bought in Sainsbury’s last year. Moroccan in origin, they claimed to be salt-cured. They were dark, squidgy and required a desalinating dip in water before you ate them. This isn’t quite Morocco, but we have black olives. I picked a batch of both small and large black fruit and researched the matter. Packed in jars with sea salt around them, apparently these will keep on getting better. The salt leaches the excess moisture and bitterness from the olives, apparently.

No questions will be asked of those who surrender their black jelly beans to BJBRS. I would rather you give them a loving end than cast them off to the bottom of the waste basket or damage their delicate psyches with hurtful words.
So, on the one hand, the police are attacked for being racist, that is, for treating blacks differently, but they are nevertheless subject to the demand that blacks be treated differently, according to the Marxist idea of need. Thus to behave in a “colour blind” manner is not something that treats everyone the same, irrespective of race or colour, but as something that recognises difference and needs, so treating them differentially because of race and colour, behaving, in other words, in a way which is paradigmatically racist according to the Macpherson Report’s own definition of racism. If certain racial groups are to be treated differently, then there is no equality before the law.

I used Echo Park paper along with some from Bella Blvd. and Little Yellow Bicycle which I thought went together nicely. I made the little flower using a lg., med., and sm. flower punch from EK Success. For the centre of the flower I used a glitter dot from Stamping Bella and coloured the top of it with a matching colour Copic. To finish everything off I added some Stickles to Kiki's cupcake and also to the centre of the flower in her hair. Here are a couple of close ups of the punched flower dot and the sparkle to her cupcake ...

I fell in love with this pattern when it came out last year, but I never got a chance to make it up. Yes, I'm making the blue one with sleeves in the lower right corner. I had to make a FBA, lengthen the waist, and add an additional 3" of length to the skirt, which, as you can see in the photo, is drafted rather short. The sleeves, however, had to be shortened by 1" and the rather wide cuffs also had to be decreased by 1/2". (Just call me T-rex!)

Romance, music, and a little humor come together in a new 2:30 minute advertisement for Nike Free Run+.

We decided to put a wall of bookshelves in my office, so it would sort of feel like a library. We already had two white Billy bookshelves from IKEA, so we bought two more for $50 each, and then eight $10 extender shelves, so that the shelves would go up really high. I wish we could have gone all the way up to the ceiling for the true 'built-in' look, but the rafters in our loft made it tricky.

The Boers hope that private all white towns like Orania, or Kleinfontein, 30 km east of Pretoria, will serve as seed-crystals for a future homeland. Today, 300 residents live in Kleinfontein. Residents do all their own work, run their own schools, and take care of the old and the poor. Impressive, permanent homes spread across the grassy hills. But when asked how long it will take to grow into a homeland, town board member Jan Groenewald admits “not in my lifetime.”

A little bit of drink, some well chosen foods, purposeful lighting, mellow incense, and some mood music and you’ve got all you need for a romantic evening with your beloved. Just find a baby sitter, put the dog out, and turn off the phone for an uninterrupted night of love. But in the case of a writer (or painter, or sculptor, or…you get the picture), these props can also be used to create an atmosphere for inspiration.

Only infantry squads get armor saves. The roll is made every time a squad takes casualties from a weapon line shot at them, as many times per turn as needed. This means that a unit targeted by another one, shot with 3 different weapon lines, will roll armor saves 3 times, and not just one after all the casualties have been added.

Moving on, as the disappointment fades away and I've taken the time to readjust and refine my goals for later in the year. I see that whatever happens, the only limits I really face are the ones I choose to accept. Even though there are some practical boundaries defined by my personal makeup, every situation which occurs brings with it a moment to stop, reflect, reassess and move forward in a redefined way. Moments of disappointment and frustration can be used to advantage to look in different directions than I'd initally hoped or planned to do. The choice is mine, do I wish to recreate my life at the moments things don't go the way I'd planned them to, or do I stay stuck in the moment, frantically trying and hoping to extricate myself from the situation I find myself in but not getting any further, and blaming the world around me for not indulging me in my wishes?

Gladstone was not quite the last Liberal to represent Greenwich. Greenwich returned a Conservative MP for the next 26 years but in the great 1906 Liberal election victory Richard Jackson was returned as Liberal member for Greenwich. He served only one term however, and most of the time since the seat has been either Labour and Conservative, apart from the SDP interlude (http://greenwichlib.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/you-never-promised-me-a-rose-garden/).
The picture for Chile includes a transition of leading causes of death along with an accelerated decline of fertility and delayed motherhood. Koch explained that direct causes –those directly attributable to pregnancy condition– were the rule before 1990, but from then, indirect causes –ie. non-obstetric chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes among others– rise as the most prevalent, hindering the decline on maternal mortality.

Before you know it, not only are there MORE weeds than the farmer started off with, but ALL of them are resistant to his preferred herbicide. Also to be taken into consideration, most weeds are angiosperms meaning they flower and their seeds are mobile. Be they blown on the wind or carried by an animal, the seeds move. Nearby "foreign" populations of pigweed get transported into the farmer's field. Of the transplants some of them too will become resistant to the herbicide, exacerbating the problem. So too, do the resistant pigweeds transplant into the "foreign" populations taking their genetic advantage with them.
Until the current economic climate is stabilized and businesses have some sense of a steady, long-term market, they are going to shy away from investment, small businesses will not grow, and jobs will not be created.

It’s an interesting and keenly observant article. However, the conclusion alluded to in the title is misguided. The writer portrays the Hipster movement as if it is the most recent heir in a rich tradition of countercultures which ends the line of succession by absorbing the mainstream, rather than rejecting it, and eventually exploding… or maybe imploding. I’m not sure. The “exploding/imploding” metaphor is mine, not his. Regardless, he says the movement ends, taking Western civilization with it.

Today is the Insecure Writers Support Group! When we flood the world wide web with our pathetic tears. Or hopefully not. Last month I shared about my eight-year-old daughter's inspirational writing habits. (She is, by the way, still at it. Just the other day she received a new diary and did she start writing about boys in it? No, she started writing a story called "The Adventures of Luthien and Dot" about her and her new baby cheetah stuffed toy. It also features some of the Thundercats.) But today, ah today! I am feeling a bit apprehensive myself and I'd like to share a little bit about what's worrying me.

I'll order a coffee, find a table by the window, and settle in for a hour or so, sipping my coffee, reading my book, and pretending I'm sitting in a Paris café on a rainy day. I'll delight in the time I've carved out for myself, doing something I enjoy.
When I go to work this evening to sell Starburst and Peanut Butter Whoppers and Coca-Cola and Jennifer’s Body, I’m going to take off my shoes for a while. I’m going to go ahead and take the chance that there might be holy space at my job. Could be that I spend way too much time waiting for God to show up when, in fact, God is already there and he is waiting on me to show up, take off my shoes, and let Him speak.

See that one at the bottom? All my income from these (seven) books will come from royalties, ALCS and PLR. If a school can make any number of copies of the book without paying a license to ALCS there will be no royalties - because why would they buy them if they can use them for free? These books with zero advance have taken the best part of eight months to write. Would YOU (non-writers) work for eight months, to be paid up to 18 months later? And how would you feel if the government then legislated away a portion of your income by saying people can steal it?
When the first inkling of stress began the day after Thanksgiving, I practiced my yoga breathing, slightly calming myself. This year I was going to focus more on the actual doing, and waaaaaaaaaay less on the getting done. To that end, and in keeping with holiday tradition, I made a list, but not a list of "to dos" or "to buys." The list isn't about accomplishing anything or checking things off of it. I titled it "Things I Enjoy about the Holidays." Over the last couple of weeks, I've been adding to it, while at the same time carefully curating, so as not to include anything out of pure obligation or because the collective "we" has been doing it forever.

The novel centers around Glyph and his father Amiante, wood-carvers and, in the case of Amiante, a very good one. But he is not particularly motivated to work harder than necessary, thus earning fewer vouchers than he might, as well as antagonizing the local representative of the Welfare Agency, most importantly by his secretly making illicit duplicates (which is forbidden worldwide for any items as simple as printed text, since most of the planet’s trading profit comes from original crafts). The novel’s main concern is Glyph’s childhood and coming-of-age, as he first notices his father’s dissatisfaction with their society, and eventually comes to share it as well. The actions which Glyph takes as a reaction to his dissatisfaction are both drastic and life-changing.
He advances towards her with heavy steps that evoke no motion in the sand beneath his bare feet. The urge to burst out and evaporate into the air now abandons him; it’s hurt so much it doesn’t hurt any more.

I like to talk about the intellectual DNA still embedded in hip hop lyrics that we need to recover, and this verse is a good example. The Common line I quote above gets right to the heart of some recent Bill Maher "real Black President" backlash. What Maher wants to say, and has said before, is that he wants his President to do the knowledge, but don't lose that thug sensibility, because Thugism is not all bad. Common nails the sentiment with room to spare should he choose to tweet it out.

Apologetic brand strategy has no place any more. In an age of transition, where revenues are at risk, publishers surrender control of their brands at their peril. But today, digitisation actually offers publishers a once-in-a-lifetime chance to re-take the initiative from the trade and re-assert their relationship with their readers.

Sadly, I think this stupid cheapo flavor injector made the recipe fail for me.

I tried to gently move the tofu around to create a pocket in there, then I delicately pressed the cheesy sauce into the tofu.

The cloud forests and lowland rainforests of Ecuador. Full of life, full of movement, full of sounds never heard before. You may not get to see all the life contained within these mystical forests, but you will certainly get to hear much of it. The toucans call to each other from the tops of the trees, while the Inca jays click and rasp back and forth, these harsh sounds interspersed with clear, bell like notes that puncture the heavy, humid air. A noisy group of oropendolas invade first one tree and then another, constantly chattering, their song a liquid harmony, like fresh water bubbling up in a small, refreshing spring, starting on its journey down a mountain creek on its way to bigger, faster streams to eventually join that mighty river, the Amazon.
Surprised? "What's a skeptical, UFO-bashing, aliens- aren't-visiting-us-and-excoriating-cow-you-know-whats scientist-type guy going around saying he loves a movie whose very premise is that not only do aliens exist, but live among us?" you are asking yourself.
All right. I know better than to expect my editor or my agent to let me know how wonderful my story is, since it would take them at least 5 minutes to read it (maybe 7 minutes if they sneeze in the middle and don't have a tissue on them). Add another minute to write me an email to say how wonderful it is, 2 minutes if they need to use the thesaurus for additional awe inspired adjectives (sure, I know marvelous and fabulous and the greatest thing ever written, but editors and agents might need a little extra help to come up with them). Fine, 3 minutes, if they need to pick and choose, and there's always a chance that they get so involved in the subtle differences between fabulous and marvelous that they forget who they're sending the email to, and have to look it up.

Today, instead of doing homework at the local mom-and-pop-café-killer, I chose to do homework in the Engineering building’s computer lab with my BF.
So, did I see a living huia that fateful day so many years ago? I’d like to think so, and I still regret the fact, that I did not try to identify the thing at once – then perhaps some other birdwatcher could have gone in and taken a closer look.

Running (if we can call it that) on the eliptical, staring through the glass doors, off into the distance, I could see myself back in the summer of the waning days of my early life. Driving home late at night. The windows open. The roof open. The cool, humid night in Ft. Lauderdale. It was the summer of '88 and I was back at home. Working two jobs. Working harder than I'd ever worked before. But loving it just the same. All my friends were home that summer. Indeed, 1988 was the last summer we all came home. Sometime the previous Fall, I'd signed up with Columbia House and ordered 12 tapes for cheap. And because I liked Magic Power, I included Triumph in my order.
Every once in a while it is possible that we get what we can call true moments of genius. I am still hoping for one sometime soon.

Jonathan Newton, a senior from Nicholasville, presented a poster on Candidate Sites for Cold H2 Formation in Cold HI Emission and Other Tracers. He has been using a survey with the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico (where he was a summer intern last year) to look for clouds of cold gas that are becoming denser and colder in preparation for forming new stars.
Let’s face it, not all of us have a secure attachment style. But if you don’t fall into this category, don’t fret. Based on our changing life experiences and deepening self-awareness (and often therapy ), you can shift your attachment style. It’s not rigid or immobile. Our relationship patterns constantly evolve and change.

Alas it was almost time to leave for our trip. Our plan was to depart from Charlotte International early one morning. At the time, I was dating a girl who lived about 20 minuetes from the Airport. A day or so before the trip I traveled three hours down to her house to spend some time with her before I left. The next night she had to go into work and I had to meet my group at a church about a few miles from the Airport. That night was restless for us all. We slept on floors, couches, and our sleeping bags until about 4 a.m. when we had to leave. I remember being woke up in the middle of the night as the first group came back to wish us the best. I barely could see the group members because it was dark and I was still half asleep. I do however remember smelling them…
It physically hurts. My heart is broken. But, I know I am lucky. And so was Charlie. He loved us unconditionally and he knew his love was requited. He left this world truly happy.

Ibis noted Bantum returning to the front of the cave talking to his chicken. He had been sitting there going over the details of his plans for the short-range future. He wanted to ensure that he would have enough energy available in the morning to use his mystic power to influence the magistrate when he met with him. However, he was quite low on energy, and so he decided against working with Korfu that night, other than to chat with him. Korfu, because he had become accustomed to his nightly Emotion Control Training with Ibis, was upset about this, despite Ibis’ explanation that it was now time for him to begin exercising emotional control on his own. Korfu felt crestfallen, but recognized that he needed to begin to control his own emotions, so he tried his best to curtail his anxiety. He sneezed, and was tired, and a bit skittish and decided to go to sleep.

My cousin takes my boyfriends side over mine? Who cares if i was wrong or right. Some family support would have helped ya know. But no, here i am trying to figure out how to approach this situation and BAM! Everyone turns against me. I dont know what is going on but i just couldnt believe it. I mean who does that?

The book’s recipes evoke homey and comforting memories of foods that perhaps we’ve never even eaten, but wish we had, all infused with Corbin’s pragmatic take on making the most of one can — there’s even a Compost Heap Jelly recipe, using up apple scraps and citrus skins. Oh, hush; it’s little more than a strained marmalade. Like many River Cottage recipes, however, it does make one pause to think about untapped potential for eating well.

I loved how this episode tried to resolve, or pointedly not resolve, the fall out from the Jeff and Annie kiss while getting to use Joel and Alison’s ridiculous chemistry to boost the genre of the week. (Intro to Political Science should have been taking notes.) It also made amazing use of the Greendale setting by incorporating the unique faculty in the A and dorms in the B. From Professor Professorson (it’s Dutch, I think it means Professor) to the very end this episode was non-stop fun.

A new month has arrived and it is actually my favorite month of the year. I love pink, hearts and fast things. For some reason, having 1-2 less days in a month makes it fly by. I am going to be starting a new monthly post on my blog. Goals for the month. Each month I always make some personal goals, but I never share them with anyone, so this month and the ones to follow, I am going to share them with you. Then I can look back and see what I accomplished.

She was up at the top of the Eiffel Tower when troops came in and evacuated it a while back. The train station was evacuated while she was sitting, waiting for a train to Dijon.

We went back to town for lunch, and then we walked through the shops for a bit before leaving to go home. We took our time driving home, and we stopped at a few outlets and for dinner along the way. We had a nice time, just the two of us, and Drew had a great time staying with Jim's mom!

I don’t know if an ice cream store can actually stalk someone, but it sure as hell feels like Baskin Robbins is stalking my family. The three of us walked out of Auntie Pasto’s; Lynnette and I waddled out of the restaurant completely full. There was a random egg – without its shell – sitting on the sidewalk and Madison was fascinated with it. She edged up to it and leaned over, pointing at it. “What happened?” she asked. I was about to make up another one of my legendary fake stories when I looked up and saw the Baskin Robbins storefront. “When did that get here?” I asked Lynnette. “I don’t know,” she said.

Ok, now stop rolling your eyes for a minute, I thought chemtrails spraying was BS too, it’s not, your government via Offices of Naval Intelligence is doing just that, its irrefutable. If it wasn’t I would not post it, and besides I have watched them doing it. It of course is experimental spraying programs with out our Consent, just like all those nuclear tests were not of our consent over Nevada a few years back. There are over 50+ weather modification programs ongoing, according to NOAA records, in the United States. What impact does this chemical manipulation have on the regional micro-climates that are needed for tree, and agricultural crop health?

The next day, Stage 2, we got up early and drove over to Howell Mountain — yes, the same place as last year. Again this year it was raining. Last year we situated ourselves up near the top of the climb, not far from the King of the Mountain sign. This year we decided to stay closer to the bottom and found a sharp hairpin turn. Then the only question was which side of the road to stand on?

It seems that message did finally break through. In September, the young woman tried to leave, but was allegedly assaulted by Boston in an alley. She ran for help to a nearby business, where police were called.
In Oakland, police using tear gas confronted a protest of about 400 downtown. Nine were arrested and at least one demonstrator was reportedly tasered. Protesters blocked streets throughout the day and vandalized two banks in the area. A news van and police vehicle were also vandalized.

Beeld newspaper has since September 2009 been sending repeated requests for a response from the Mining Department’s spokesman Jeremy Michaels without any replies. Between May and September last year more than R7,5-million were paid to Padmodzi gold. Now the mine has been taken over by Aurora – a black-economic empowerment group in which a grandson of Nelson Mandela and a nephew of president Jacob Zuma are involved together. “Since that time no pumping subsidy has been paid,’ said Bhana. He was pinning all his hopes on ‘a Malaysian partner to advance the money for the miners’ salaries’.

After Wodrick took the time to barricade himself in the west wing of the central manor, he did a quick search and found a small locked coffer in an office (chest sized to a gnome). Cackling at his luck, the crafty gnome bard hefted the container and looked for another way out...Billy Palsy and Barry Picaroon ran through a hysterical crowd following a duped guard toward the last tower in the garrison. The one holding the prison block. Once inside they ascended some stairs and were met by the loyally unmoving turnkey of the prison tower. Not a bluff from Billy nor an intimidating threat from Barry would move this man. "If the tower caught on fire, the scum in here would deserve to burn!" he declared. In a hurry, Palsy knifed the duped guard and Blonde Barry clubbed the turnkey unconscious. Taking both their uniforms off, they hurried up to the cells above to find Ironclaw McGrath.

The conversation Elizabeth David recorded took place in 1951, three years after de Beistegui bought the house from a Labia widow, and only six years after the end of the Second World War - a war that had laid waste to Europe, the East, and to unimaginably vast numbers of people, in the Shoa, on battlefields and at sea, and which rewrote the manuals on Fascism for succeeding generations. Undoubtedly, in those early years of reparation and repair, an ostentatious event such as the Villa Labia ball could be viewed as a rich foreigner's attempt to buy his way into an old and hermetic society - much in the same way as did the Labia family centuries before - and, given the rawness of the early post-war years, perceived as spitting in the face of the still-suffering populations of Europe. That is how, I think, the young man in Elizabeth David's tale saw the situation. If I have taken his measure correctly, the young man, the anti-hero, saw the situation for what it was.

Although there are inevitably some similarities with Horace McCoy’s depression-era classic They Shoot Horses Don’t They?, there is nothing as grimly deterministic in its social commentary here as we follow the shifting fortunes of the contestants. Though there are 16 competitors to begin with, right from the start all eyes are on the rivalry between reigning champion Captain Erskine Chadwick, who from his side bets stands to win a whopping £11,000, and the young pretender Charles Durrell. Their contest takes place in a privileged space on the internal track reserved for gentlemen, while on the outer track run all the others from the lower social classes – the most eccentric of which is the completely inexperienced Francis Mostyn whose motives for participating are a mystery. At the end of each day we are given a summary of everyone’s progress with a table of the miles and laps run. Lovesey spends quite a lot of time setting up the basic situation and all the characters so that sergeant Cribb only makes his appearance a third of the way in when Durrell dies, apparently of tetanus. He is a serious and intelligent man, not much interested in running as a sport and who proves to be a smart judge of character, changing interrogation technique depending on the person in question. Cribb’s deductions are always logical and plausible, though I’m still not entirely convinced about how fairly he solved the case (more about that below)
This pregnancy has been uneventful just as they were with both Abby and Jocelyn. As April 18th approaches I find every emotion go through my mind. I am excited. Excited to hold a newborn baby girl. I’m nervous. Nervous about how I will juggle life with 3 little ones to take care of. I'm grateful. Grateful that everything is telling us that baby girl is healthy and strong. I’m scared. Scared that something unexpected will happen. I’m anxious. Anxious that the delivery wont go as planned. I’m hopeful. Hopeful that after the arrival of Baby Girl that some healing will have taken place as the emotions are still so raw from the delivery and weeks that followed with Sweet Jocelyn Rose. As my due date approaches I find the emotions of nervousness, being scared, anxiousness fading. Excitement, gratefulness and being hopeful are now consuming my thoughts. She will be perfect, just like her big sisters, I just know she will:)
3. Hot Corners and Charm bars
Yesterday morning, my oh so cute dog, Bailey, decided she was going to eat something she shouldn't be eating. When I tried to get it out of her mouth, she ran away from me and jumped over the couch. I ran around the couch because trying to jump over it would have been a disaster and comical. The door to the large dog crate was open, but I didn't see it because it was dark. So while running I tripped over the crate door, some how cutting my finger and shoulder and scraping my knee. Then I slammed my face into the end table. The disaster was inevitable apparently.

Mao created the Chinese identity under a Marxist-Leninist understanding of history. History according to Marx is the history of class struggle. It conceives the present class struggle as an incarnation of past struggles, a continuation of history through class struggle. Because Mao’s discourse was so widely accepted it became truth. The History of China was of past, present and future. China was great, British imperialism put it to its knees, and now China will rise again. This idea, and the Chinese identity, is accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Chinese.

More and more people nowadays are looking for alternative ways to earn more income. Having one day job seems to be not enough to sustain an average household anymore.

I stand and look at myself in the locker room mirror before I head out and face the run that lays ahead of me. I battle with the instinct to pick apart every imperfection I have. A run is something I always enjoy - it has become a healthy release, and a way to try and reclaim a healthy version of the body that carried 6 kids.
The ultimate point of my PhD on the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) management between 1870 and 1910 is to determine the quality of managers' and directors' decisions in the period. Therefore, I deal with questions surrounding what drove decisions and what decision-makers knew when making them. One event I focus on is the LSWR and Midland Railway’s lease of the Somerset and Dorset Railway (SDR) in 1875.
It’s at this point that people who notice these kinds of truths about government and politicians are thankful that we have a way of getting rid of politicians once they’ve traded away their integrity for a self-congratulating policy of media-induced-compassion.
Edwin Moore's quirky collection of a hundred encounters between (mostly) important historical figures is a gem of a book.

I found it funny that Letizia Mancino thought that Seattle has steeper hills than San Francisco. I have never slipped and fallen on the hills in Seattle, but I once took a bad fall in San Francisco when we were living in California. Eveyone passing by just stared and made comments, but no one helped me up. My purse had opened and the contents were spread all around me. I had to painfully get up, gather up my belongings and hobble back to the beauty salon on Knob Hill to recover myself. I had fallen so hard that I found a hole in the knee of my pants.
Fuck. That. Noise.
2. Connections were made: To me, that’s the real value of a TweetUp; connecting with folks in real-time. Business cards were flying everywhere!

Ended the day with some planning of my year. Because with Esteff, since she only has 3 months left she’s stressing a little with everything she wants to do before she leaves. So I was inspired to start early with my list of places to go. First things first. I need to open a savings account. For all my travelling and of course taxes. (Everyone that doesn’t know I came on the worst time of the year for tax reasons. I’ll pay the most, since I worked the whole year basically!)
Dad winds the old family clock. It was a wedding gift to my grandmother and grandfather, Dad's parents. I think. I believe Dad told me that his mom carried that clock in her lap from Oklahoma to California during the Dust Bowl years. It meant an awful lot to her. I remember it chiming in her home. I always thought it was the most fantastic thing.
holy calamity - i told you yesterday i had a wake to go to and it was for a girlfriend i knew since i was 5 years old (we're not close, our circle of friends were friends, but we never clicked, but never any issue with us, we just never hung one on one) her Mom, who passed away suddenly in her sleep - i had my sh*t together walking in and waiting on the line (her hubby is the top county cop guy - so let's just say if you wanted to rob a house in the county there would of been no issue, b/c every cop was there) and THEN i finally hit the room and i saw the pictures of her, happy with her family - oh yes i started to choke up - i remember her like that, always happy, loven' the sun like me, ect) - THEN i saw Mrs. V laying there - i LOST IT - i mean literally people must of been like 'who is this girl, she's crying like it's her own Mom' - but THERE ya go - that's exactly what i thought - HOLY sh*t that will be my Mom next - and then all the questions of - OMG HOW, WHAT, WHO, WHERE, WHAT come rushing in - how do you go on?! - i mean really???

At any rate, he says that the elections in Europe don’t say much about the policy concerns of the European voters, as the results are mostly about the principle that, “voters toss out incumbents and reward insurgents if the economy is bad, never mind the specifics of their platforms.” So, he says, France is not moving to the left but, yes, Greece is really fubar.

Afterwards, I commented, “Dude, that was pretty funny… language was a little in your face though”. I said this for my mother’s benefit, because there were some words and phrases in there that I really am sure she hasn’t had too much experience with. Her response:

Charles and Jones have a different relationship. Jones puts his brilliance on the back burner and defers almost wholly to the surpassing genius of Charles. This might be somewhat like the famous line about the brilliant mathematician Johnnie Von Neumann: "There are three branches of math. Applied. Pure. And Johnnie Von Neumann."

They where all sitting around the fire, in front of the C&D´s, beer and wine bottles making their round. Some of the boys had something to smoke which circulated in the round too. Sitting in the sand, watching her friends get drunk and high the Persian Princess´ mood changed: She was bored. At the moment when she decided to go inside, suddenly a known Indian came to the group. He looked at the girl, who wasn´t a virgin since last night anymore: But she doesn´t even looked back.A short smile in the face of the Persian Princess: You bloody stupid beach boy, that´s what you get now, see! The moment this thought flashes though her mind, Prince Charming sat down next to her: „You are looking a little bored.“ True she thought, but does she really feel in the mood to chat with this boy again? Whatever, maybe better than chatting with her drunk and high friends. At least Prince Charming seemed to be in a condition to talk.

But the self-imposed pox on food waste made for interesting meal options, too. My leftover eggs from baking, garlic chive butter from Christmas meals, and some sad-looking shitakes and green onions made for a fabulous morning omelet for one. Our leftover veggies made for good low-mein and stirfries, and this morning we're using the last of our breads and eggs for French toast. Our trimmings we redoubled our efforts in piling back on our compost pile, and we made no processed goods.

A critique levied by RPM party boss Boubacar Touré, among others, is that the new cabinet shows too much influence from neighboring heads of state, particularly Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso. The most senior cabinet member, Sadio Lamine Sow, placed in charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has served as a special adviser to Compaoré in Ouagadougou for several years. The new Minister of Communications and Information Technology is Hamadoun Touré, who as spokesman for the United Nations mission in Côte d’Ivoire last year was seen as someone close to Ivoirian President Alassane Dramane Ouattara. Notably, the cabinet includes several “Maliens de l’exterieur” — like the prime minister himself, these are migrants who’ve spent much of their professional lives abroad.

The highest aspiration for a young Jewish man in Jesus’ day was to become a rabbi. To become rabbi, you needed to become a rabbi’s disciple. This was not easy. Prospective disciples applied to the rabbis they wished to follow. If the rabbi believed that the young man had the intelligence and the integrity to do what he did, he accepted the prospective disciple with the words, “follow me.” If he rejected the young man, he would encourage him to go home and ply the family trade.

*My parents completely surprised me with a Kindle Fire for Christmas. As anti-eReader as I was forever (hello, desire to work in the PRINT publishing industry)... I'm hooked. Like, it is my precious baby and don't come near it. We're one in the same. The bond? With my Kindle? It is powerful. Truly though, it is SO handy on the train/shuttle and weighs much less than the three books I routinely carry for my daily commute (a girl's gotta have her literary options). So... Kindle Fire. It's good, pretty stuff.

I’m in the process of selling my books on Barnes and Noble.com and maybe getting them into Barnes and Noble Book stores. From reading the directions on the bn website, it seems fairly easy. They just need your ISBN and a copy of your book plus other information. I’ve also considered sending extra used copies I have at home to Powell’s Books. They offer the option to sell your used books online as well in their stores. I have no control over the book prices on Lulu. However, I think one way to get people to buy more books could be to sell them used which would lower the cost. Especially since the Graphic Novels are all being printed in color and can get a little expensive. I think selling them Barnes and Noble and Powell’s is a good idea.
Then it happened. It rose out of the bowl and came cascading down the side.
It's a far out psychedelic space rock epic. The first two tracks are really great jams not unlike those of Brainticket or Can, with longing vocals that don't make much sense and all kinds of heavy loose grooves gliding along. The second side is mostly a more mellow track, with spacey drawn-out guitar sketches and ending with a build of drums and bass. It's a really nice example of the more spaced-out side of progressive rock, created with as much energy as anything. - Matthew Foster
So this is the first Science Fiction type story I'm doing. The other three were kind of romantic/comedy stuff, the first two being high-school set. Also the first time I plan on telling the story from multiple viewpoints.

The terms are used interchangeably, and almost always indicate an individual in jail for slave condition. The vast majority of said individuals were held under the reason, “busque amo” — awaiting the search for a new master, awaiting a pending sale, etc. Masters who used the jail for this purpose were required to provide food and clothing for the slave. Ecuador didn’t fully abolish slavery until 1852, and as you can see on your chart, in 1853 there are no afro-descendant entrants.

It might be a sign that I have read too many of Dr Carson’s books if they no longer truly impact me where I am at any given moment. I have read a lot of his books. I have listened to a lot of his sermons. I have read a lot of his formal journal contributions. I am like a junky for Carson, at one time actually spending money to purchase very poor cassette tape audio recordings of his sermons. But this time I found myself finishing his sentences and skipping over time-worn illustrations and yawning. The Cross and Resurrection of Jesus are amazing, mind blowing, earth shattering, soul undoing events. As Tim Keller notes: If Jesus is who he said he is, then everything changes.

We've got people with tastes all over the map, but we might just get lucky and if four or five of us can agree on a selection, I think that would be pretty cool. Think about it and let me know if you'd be interested and if so, maybe suggest a list of books you're interested in reading that might be more interesting if you knew others were reading them too.
People often don't think about where they can position themselves for where they can get a photo where something in front is in focus and everything else is blurry. You can still see the background, but it's creating a sort of lost feeling sometimes. When things are blurred in your depth of field and they create a pattern that is interesting, it's called bokeh. Generally this happens with the bokeh in the background but it can be used in the foreground instead. Use depth of field and get into the mode of the subject you're photographing.
This year, it's even more indulgent, more group-y, more dorky and therefore more awesome.
Thus, we can learn from Bernard Weisberg’s career that an insistence upon looking for the good in others not only testifies to the best in oneself but also helps to suppress the worst in the world at large. Consider (by way of contrast) how revealing have been the recent allegations out of Moscow about the drugs and madness-inducing methods to which a supposed KGB defector was subjected in this country—allegations which inadvertently expose much more what goes on in the Soviet Union than what goes on here. And consider also how revealing has been the inability of the current South African government to see anything but foreign conspiracy and Communist agitation in the persistent efforts there to secure racial justice. Far more healthy is the Weisberg approach, which is that of the fair-minded judge who, in giving others their due, assures one and all of his own confident integrity and his professional competence. We should be reminded, by the illustrations from abroad that I have just used, of the grave risks run by systematically resorting to blatantly political tests for potential judges. Integrity and competence, not “ideological” partisanship, are what we should insist upon—and these we do have, in good measure, in the new Magistrate for this District, an officer whose virtues enhance the stature of this office for his successors.

For years I would freak out over my belly, which at 185-200 lbs is usually able to sit against my thighs when I am seated. Even when I was ill, throwing up every day, unable to eat more than apple sauce and saltines for 30 days straight and had lost 40 lbs from the lack of anything but the barest sustenance I still had a little pouch of fat hanging beyond my stomach muscles. Especially when my cycle got going and I got bloated, I would have days when I was so uncomfortable in my own skin that i would literally tear my clothes off and freak out crying for hours.

They may have faults, and sins they are struggling with, but you see, God does not call me (or anyone else) to be the Holy Spirit. It is not our jobs to convict people of their wrongdoings. That is not to say we can never point them out. But, for single young ladies like myself, I think we should really be striving to focus wholly on the Lord and OUR relationship with HIM. Instead of focusing on others' shortcomings, we should be focusing on our own, and repenting from them.

Finally, I re-read Hater by David Moody. Again, self-publishers take note: Moody secured a film deal with Guillermo del Toro after he published Hater under his own imprint. I read Hater last fall in a single afternoon because I couldn't put it down. (That rarely happens to me.) It's been compared to 28 Days Later, but I think that does it a disservice. Hater begins with a focus on a beleaguered man as he struggles through a global outbreak of inexplicable violent acts. About two-thirds of the way through, the whole thing turns on its head. This is one of those books that takes you so deeply into its characters, you're willing to go anywhere with them. I read it again in January in anticipation of reading its sequels, Dog Blood and Them or Us.

As I reported in my first review, the trailer for Devil piqued my interest, to say the least. With a story by M.

At first I thought, "Of course. Isn't that common sense?" Initially I was thinking about it in terms of needing to teach them what they are feeling.

"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."

What we did for "Fun Friday": It was a rainy day, which means it is a good day to stay inside around here since you practically need a boat to get around parts of our yard when it is wet. The kids played a few "games" online (Ooka Island, Big Bibletown), colored in their doodle books, tried their hands at I Spy, worked on paper dolls (the girls), and listened to Adventures in Odyssey. You can listen to episodes online at OnePlace and even watch episodes at Jelly Telly.

I started this year with no outside commitments for myself. My only job in life right now is to be a supportive and loving wife to Matt and to raise, love, enjoy, teach, and care for our children. (**My only...as if it were a small task- Ha) Oh yes and let's not forget taking care of the home.
She loves the Slinky Malinki series, so I was happy to find this at the library. This one brings out the 'villian' of the original for his own spot in the limelight. He isn't afraid of anything, but himself! I will end up buying it because she'll have it re-read as much as the others.
“They’re courting prosecution. ... They’re increasingly behaving like if we were in the middle of World War II and they learned of plans to invade Normandy. Because they decided it’s a matter of public interest, they’d publish it,” Mr. Schoenfeld said. “I think this is reckless and likely to encourage Attorney General Gonzales to prosecute them, if not for this story, for some of the other things they’ve done.”
Does anyone know the truth about Nadya? The grandmother didn’t even know she got the $168K disability payments while she was churning out babies with a disabled back. And if it is true that she was paid it is a Dr Mengele type of wrongness.
17. Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo. —James Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916)

It is a struggle in the twenty-first century, but even though we downsized our home, we increased our property, have clean air and clean water and a minimum of electronic noise surrounding us. It’s not for everyone, but it can be done if you take the time to study your choices and get in touch with what you want out of life…”
Strong customer response to higher-priced items, including big-screen TVs, mattresses and certain jewelry offerings contributed to a slight uptick in average selling price in the quarter, as well as a more modest increase in units shipped and an expected increase in return rates.

I don't know how many people will respond to this, but let me know if there are any units or activities that you are wanting to have created--I have been so exhausted lately, but I want to get back into making TPT/TN creations soon!! All ideas welcomed, and might throw it as a freebie your way ;) Have a great Thursday tomorrow!
2) Training. You can train your dog not to bark out the window by taking the following steps. First, make sure your dog is exercised. Second, place a leash on your dog (preferable not a flexi-leash since you cannot give a proper leash correction with one easily). Third, purposefully create the barking scenario. You need to make the barking occur so that you can stop it in that moment (thus showing your dog what is expected of them). For example, if your dog is a leash barker, walk past lots of other dogs. If your dog is a window barker, ask a friend to walk in front of the window with their dog. Fourth, correct early on. As soon as your dog begins to become obsessed (you’re looking for level 2 excitement–don’t wait until level 10 when they are already barking like crazy) give a calm, quiet leash correction to the side (think “snap” of the leash: loose, tense for 1 second, then loose again). Give the correction when your dog’s ears go up, his tail becomes alert, or he gets anxious. Do not become frustrated. You are teaching your dog a new concept: that barking is no longer acceptable behavior. Remember that when you discipline your dog you are disagreeing with the behavior, not with the dog personally. Fifth, repeat, repeat, repeat!

The operation of trafficking, particularly across borders, requires some contacts within official Government departments and law enforcement. Officials will arrange for fake travel documents, access across borders and early release on arrest. Law enforcement can also assist in asserting control over the victim. For example, trafficked women in Karachi, even if they find themselves free from their confinement, have no protection. The police will demand ‘bhatta’ in exchange for their protection. They are often victimised under the Hudood Ordinances and Foreigners Act 1946, have no access to attorneys (although the traffickers have no problem in getting access to them). Police could help victims in attaining prosecutions against their aggressors of rape liable to tazir under various components of the Hudood Ordinances, by questioning trafficked victims as witnesses against the agents; but this is never done.
First things first: I am not normally a printable maker. I don't have fancy software, nor do I know how to use fancy software. BUT, I had an idea and I successfully figured out how to make it using what I have on my computer.

The terracotta warriors in Xian was discovered in 1974 by a farmer, digging a well on his land. The site was opened to visitors in 1976 and declared a UNESCO world cultural heritage site in 1987. Current estimates are that the three pits contain about 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses.

Matthew was so, so, so, excited to be baptized on his 8th birthday! We were so excited and proud of him and his decision to follow the example of the Savior. Matthew was baptized and confirmed by Jeremy. Both of his grandpas served as witnesses and Grandma Cox gave a talk on the Holy Ghost. He was so happy the rest of the day and we talked about how that was the Holy Ghost letting him now he made the right decision. The next day Matthew gave a talk about his feelings about being baptized to his class. Throughout the day I kept thinking about his blessing day. It seemed like yesterday he was a sweet little baby that I was dressing for his blessing and now he has made a covenant with God.After Matthew's baptism and confirmation (and while we still had our family and friends gathered at the church), Calvin was given a name and a beautiful blessing by Jeremy. We are so grateful for this sweet little guy and what he has added to our family. Like all our other babies, Calvin had a special blessing blanket made in Bethlehem that I brought home from Israel.

“After your disappearance, your wife went ballistic. She was distressed and quite few of your relatives and neighbors went out looking for you to no avail. She was then ‘advised’ to approach a certain man starting up a new business; a man with psychic, supernatural powers.

The plus side of being Properly Poorly is that I’ve been forced to slow down and catch up with some reading. Briefly:
When we send out our invitations for the reunion we put a little reminder that we are having an auction and to be working on your stuff. We try to do this because we do mostly handmade items. It can be anything you can make and some store bought stuff pops in too (mostly candy). We have had jewelry, purses, aprons, bridles, cookies, fudge, caramel apples, jerky, Christmas ornaments, pillowcases, coupons for babysitting, really the items cover a wide range of stuff.
After he left the building, Connor went to the nearest trashcan, yanked his unfinished Simple Machines project from his binder, and tore it in half, then in quarters. The term was over; there was no point in hanging onto it now. A few pieces of tattered paper fluttered to the ground as he stuffed the can. Not bothering to pick them up, Connor hurried to the school parking lot and found Taylor, leaning against the back of his Chevy pick-up and talking to Tawnya Garcia. His best friend was decked out in his usual gear...a letterman jacket and the most recent ‘funny’ tee-shirt he picked up at Wal-Mart. This one read, I didn’t say it was you’re fault...I said I was going to blame you.
What, you might be wondering, is my excuse for such a prolonged period of absence from writing? At least I hope somebody is wondering that or I may as well not trouble myself. I’ve never been much of a writer and I struggle even at my least busy to output my thoughts in such a way that people might actually want to read them but whether I ever achieve that aim is less than certain anyway, so I may as well endeavour to become a more productive blogger.
The Chardham is one of the most religious excursions for Hinduism. It comprises of four pilgrimage places namely Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Among Hindus Chardham Yatra is considered to be a journey of moksha where one accepts his activities, search for blessings of almighty and finally returns with serenity of mind. All these four places are associated with various mythologies and have high religious ethics. One may however commence his journey from Haridwar or Delhi. It is advisable to proceed after having a holy dip in holy river Ganga. All the places are situated in the Garhwali Himalayas region of Uttarakhand.
This one verse offers God the opportunity to "dig out" the deep roots of our thoughts, sets us on a pathway of healing from the past, and reminds us to look to Him for our future. And if you're like me--struggling with those pesky memories or wishes that never seem to give you peace--try praying this prayer yourself. God is faithful. He can lead and guide you in all areas--even your thought life.

Here is another indicator that I have found to be quite reliable. The cumulative advance/decline line of the Russell 2000. Once again I am using a 3 week exponential moving average here. When it begins to hook to the upside that is generally a pretty good sign of a bottom. Note that it turned down in late-July 2011, up in early-October 2011, up again in late-December 2011, and turned down again in February 2012. I suspect that when this begins to turn up again the market will likely be at an important low.

Watts indicates a balance every journalist is facing between putting enough of themselves into their social media to seem human, while remaining professional. When she says reporters are reporters, part of what she means is that many of the old rules apply to new platforms, such as fact checks and leaving personal opinion out of it – even on staff blogs.

Except if you look in the one file where all of my business records are haphazardly lumped together…Things have been piling up since I opened my shop in December and if I don’t do something, they will only get worse. And next year’s taxes are going to be a nightmare.

9. What’s the last city you visited?
for myself,
The easiest and quickest way to get to Kingston from Central London is to take the suburban train service from Waterloo. There are trains every 15 minutes (half that on Sundays) and on a good day, the journey takes 28 minutes. Having arrived at our destination, we set out to perform a circuit of the town. We did not have a specific route in mind but more or less “followed our noses”, recording whatever interested us along the way.
On Wee Z's first birthday, we had 2 small parties for him with various family members and friends. On the Saturday before his birthday my Dad, Grandma and younger Sister came to visit. The sun was splitting the sky and it was a really lovely day. We had a picnic in the garden and my Sister helped Wee Z play with his new toys.

The next startling moment for Puck and I was when we realized there was drinking everywhere and anywhere in the outdoor space. Yep buy your glass, your tokens and fill up before heading to the playground to watch the children. The glass pictured here, has a few sips out of it after Puck and I split the "taster in half". The glasses were being filled to the brim.

As soon as I said gossip, some of you had a picture of a person who gossips all the time pop into your head, wonder if anyone pictured you? Gossip has been an issue in the church for as long as it has been around but that does not make it right at all. We do a number of things to try to cover our tracks when it comes to gossip: we use the “prayer request” cover, we use the “I am only sharing this with you because I care” cover, or we use the “I am not gossiping because I am pretty sure it is true” cover. The Bible has some hard words for those who like to gossip. We should not associate ourselves with gossip or gossipers.

I also like this 72-inch rope of mixed chocolate, peach, mocha and white freshwater pearls. Dyed, yes, but the mix is subtle and sprightly. Size of pearl not specified, but they will, I'm guessing, be smallish (3-6mm) and that's fine for this very long scatter-strung rope, which you can wear so many ways. From Blue Nile; price, $85.

From CNN:
“This briefing paper and draft contempt report explains the case, to both Members of the Committee and the American people, for holding Attorney General Holder in contempt of Congress,” said Issa. “In describing the results of the Justice Department’s refusal to cooperate – including the hardships the family of a fallen Border Patrol agent have faced in seeking the truth, and retaliation against agents who blew the whistle on gunwalking – this briefing paper provides the facts, on which decisions will be made.”
Taking an example from the world of business. Henry Ford first built an assembly line to produce cars. This was a revolutionary concept at the time. Yet, people now could not imagine putting things together without an assembly line. It is so much more effective in terms of staff, resources, and work flow. To me, best practices are something we all do (such as story times), and they determine what the best, most cost-effective, and patron friendly way of doing this program or service.
Guess what, I don’t want to do any of it.
Reassessment starts with students filling out a Google form, stating when they want to take it and which chapters they need reassessments for. When they submit the form all of the data is dumped into a Google spreadsheet that tells me at a glance which reassessments I need ready for any given day. Students must sign up at least 48 hours prior to the date of reassessment so I have time to write a new reassessment if I need to.
Merriam-Webster’s Pocket Guide to English Usage supports the point about how each form has its particular virtues:

When I was 15, Dad got paroled. I was thrilled! At last he and I would get a place to live and I would be with a parent who understood me. The first thing Dad had to do was get a job, which he did – in Montgomery (those long 60 miles away). Then he got a room, explaining that he would rent a house or apartment when he could afford it. Then demanded his parents get him a car, which they promptly did. We never lived together, but he came home on weekends and since I had my learners permit, we would go out driving. I would drive and he would drink, cautioning me not to let Mama know.

Love is practical action, not romanticized idea. It is not conditional. It does not depend on whether I woke up on the right side of the bed today. It does not depend on whether another person is "worth" loving as I judge love, the person, the situation, all three.

"How else, my love, do you prefer to meet?" Regret emerged before any other thought.
The most convincing portrayal of human lovesickness is in a film called The Name of the Rose. Christian Slater is an apprentice monk who falls for a stunningly sensual beggar girl played by Valentina Vargas. He has no idea what to do about it, but it doesn’t matter because she takes charge of the situation, pulling off the lad’s habit and literally engulfing him in her yearning flesh. Little Christian’s boyish bottom is exposed to the world, while Valentina mews like a cat being simultaneously stroked by eleven pairs of hands. And throughout their brief encounter, they never exchange a single word. Inevitably, it all comes to grief when a bearded troll from the Inquisition arrives at the monastery, charging around the place making reckless accusations and flashing his deadly instruments. The tragic ending is a familiar denouement in human love stories, although in this one the parted lovers do at least escape with their lives.

I can already hear the reactions of some of the people at book club, and they won’t be good. It’s long and the print is small. One of the men struggles with female attitudes to sex, in my opinion, so probably won’t enjoy the bits about the female orgasm. I, naturally, will defend it on principle. He is a narrow man, a man who is prejudiced without realising it, and it has become my raison d’être of book club to disagree with his opinions. But while I know that clearly, I’m not sure how I feel about it myself.
There’s a lot of new characters in this season, which is hardly surprising. Obviously some fall into stereotypes, but for the most part I think they’re originally enough to get more than a passing score. To add to that, the main character is original and very funny, probably even more so than the first season. His “assistant” isn’t going to gather any points, but I feel she works well as his sidekick. In retrospect I kind of view them as a Manzai team – where she is “the straight man” and he’s “the funny man”. They don’t really fit into those role that well at all, but just very vaguely. I mean, he does and says some crazy things every now and then, which she, “the straight man”, counters with normality.

In other Spring-related news the clocks are going forward on Saturday, so I will be losing an hour's worth of sleep (boo!). This means darker mornings for a bit, but lighter evenings. One of my favourite things about living in the Northern Hemisphere is that, in summer, it stays light until 10:00pm at night. I love how you can leave work at 17:30 and still feel like you have a substantial evening ahead of you. I will also no longer have to run in the dark, hunkering close to the H37 bus route and sprinting passed dark alleyways and spooky driveways ... it's the small things in life.

-LB Casey Matthews looks like he can be the starting MLB for the Eagles this year. I watched him on almost all the live hitting defensive snaps that he was in on, and he filled his gap great. Even in pass coverage, Matthews stayed in his zone and looked like a vet out there. I guess reports that he’s picking up the scheme very quick are accurate.

I noticed my favorite detail of all when I went to change the toilet paper a few days ago (the above picture is just a dramatization). I should backstory that I’ve always been slightly irritated by the standard toilet paper holder that you have to press in to change the toilet paper and put it back. At our old house the whole thing would routinely fall apart and the spring would go flying. Little did I know that this was an option!

I admit that if you play WAB, specially coming from fantasy, this will be a bit of a hassle. Most people base their cavalry in 25x50mm or 50x50mm bases. This is nice, but it´s not that good for Warmaster or even FOG. And you know what? Most historical cavalry figures are smaller than fantasy horses.
Anyway, I went through the entire list of questions and irrational arguments on this new blog, and also had a look at the so-called errors. Bear in mind that “The Rooster” is suggesting that there are numerous errors. He basis this argument on the fact that the 1994 - 2011 list also contains names of victims prior to 1994.
The initial thing I should explain about this system is that it is actually a 5.1 sound system, which is one of the better systems around. Surprisingly many individuals don’t know what a 5.1 system is, so I will go over the basics with you. This kind of system basically has 6 speakers to present you with the best sound possible. The particular speakers that come with this particular system are a bass speaker, along with a center speaker, 2 speakers for your multichannel surround sound and naturally 2 speakers for the stereo sound. When these speakers come together you will see that you are getting some of the best sound you have ever listened to if you haven’t had a 5.1 system yet.

Low point: at the end, when some bright spark had decided to take down the big letters that you go to to meet up with people afterwards, so 14,000 women all dressed the same were stoating around in the wind and rain trying to find their pals.

When I finished high school in 2001, I was offered several scholarships to Otterbein College, where I'd be in a top-notch Theater program. All the scholarships put together paid for tuition and housing, so off I went with a beard I'd recently taken to wearing long and uncut and long hair to match. I brought my little brother and sister up to see campus when I moved in: a friend later told me that when he saw me for the first time, I was holding my six-year-old sister by the hand, pointing up toward what was actually my dorm room but he mistook for the heavens. Jesus is here, he thought. I am seeing a vision of Jesus on our campus.
In the meantime, we see the President of the United States talking trash to the people of Arizona while bowing and scraping to the President of Mexico. We also see his assistant secretary of state, a guy named Michael Posner, a wuss who no doubt spent his high school years being given well-deserved wedgies, denouncing Arizona to those paragons of virtue and defenders of human rights, the Red Chinese!

One note I should add...don't be afraid to use games for your own purposes. For example: use the Scrabble tiles to just make words, without actually playing the game by the rules; for that matter, alter rules however it makes sense for your players; and don't keep score if it's frustrating for any of the players. In my opinion, it's best to have the game serve your purposes, rather than always strictly follow the rules as written.

I was there, snapping away at the flowers, and was asked to pull double duty. It was a fancy little party, so my jeans were minorly mortifying. Afterwards I immediately met a friend for dinner and ordered the best steak of my life. Or at least, the most well earned.

The woman near Christian tried to hang on him again but he glared at her and shoved her away from him. “Well go find out what it was.” He held his hand to his head, his wedding band sparkling under the light as he motioned for the vampire to leave. Glaring at the woman, the evil in Christian’s stare made her tremble. “You taste disgusting. Get away from me.”

Meats: In order to have this body, you must consume meat. I’m not willing to help anyone who subscribes to a vegan lifestyle. I have nothing against it (other than loads of scientific evidence) but I don’t have any advice for people who cannot or will not eat meat. A variety of protein sources are very necessary when you engage in physical activity. It is mandatory to have healthy portions of meat to encourage muscle growth and healing time. When you are at the supermarket look for these types of meats in particular to add to your diet: Lean ground meat (12% or less), lean ground turkey, sliced turkey, skinless chicken breast, cube steak, any lean cuts of beef, all fish and seafood, including canned tuna. Meats you should avoid are hot-dogs, sausage, fatty ground meats, links, breakfast meats, cured-meats (which are high in sodium), salamis and deli-style meats (too much sodium). Feel free in being creative in your meat preparation, but keep these suggestions in mind. Use olive-oil in your cooking instead of butter or cooking oil. Do not roll your meat in flour. Add plenty of fresh herbs, spices and veggies to flavor your meat. Marinades are fine. Baking, and grilling are the best way to cook your meat. In general, the best portion size for meats are 4-6oz for females and 6-8oz for males, but this depends on your specific goal which we will discuss in a later blog.
I don't like looking at chemtrails, I've always had a bad feeling about them, the reason being the high potential we are witnessing the ongoing anthropogenic battle for control of Nature. It bothers me to see something so obvious be ignored and denied. They illustrate perfectly for all to see, the vast void of respect westernized humanity bears toward the natural world preferring to throw its full support into a broken system. And chemtrails are ugly, far too Jackson Pollack binging on jet fuel for my taste.
Both Sweet Home and Clarence concluded their investigations on Monday, April 30. Although there was no admission of using a racial slur by any Clarence lacrosse player, we have determined that there is evidence to believe that the allegations of wrongdoing have merit. Additionally, the mere existence of such allegations demands that we respond accordingly.
As for the standards themselves, I'm comparing them closely with the standards currently in place in Louisiana. For my part they just don't seem as good. Also disturbing is the movement away from classical texts and literature in general to non-fiction and technical writing. Now, we do a pretty good bit of non-fiction in my classes. To a certain extent teachers can pick and choose the selections from the text. You don't necessarily have to real ALL the fiction, or ALL the non-fiction, for example. You follow your pacing guide, hit all your standards and benchmarks, and select a fair representation from each genre (in 10th grade, anyway).

Today is my firstborn’s twentieth birthday. Strange that when one beautiful relationship was blossoming another was crumbling like a house of cards. Sometimes I wonder what is this strange relationship I share with my boys. They are my sons, best friends, confidante and much more. There is a much deeper bond that connects us where age is no bar. I think despite of all the blows that life gave the journey was one hell of a crazy fun trip with both. Trust me raising two brats is not for weak hearted. I have had my share of tears and laughter.

Beer blogging has broadened the reach of real beer, it has given air to opinions and trends and marketing strategies, it has allowed those undiscovered diamonds to find an appreciative audience and it has brought together some good honest beer lovers who love to share a beer – real or virtual.

As said I was bounced around the Hebden and swear I seen nothing but perhaps heard plenty of late 1940's life. A fox (not the same one) is a mascot of our city team of Carlisle United.

Who’s to say that the wall clock is accurate? My desktop icon insistently begs to differ by a full four minutes. No matter how often I reset the confounded thing, back it jumps to its own silicon mediated timekeeping. Could always page the speaking clock- does that even still exist in this digital age?- but all our calls are monitored, so how incriminating might that look? I would be court-martialled and make no mistake. Padded shoulders lopped off with a letter opener.

Yesterday, the UFO reappeared — in the saucy British tabloid The Sun, renewing interest in the night lights over northeastern China. Accompanying a photo, The Sun wrote that a "major" airport "was forced to shut down to prevent packed passenger jets crashing into a UFO." Without citing a source, the paper described the object as, quote, "flat and tubular" (a seeming oxymoron ) and wrote that it "hovered two miles from Bootee" (its transliteration of Baotou). "Astonished officials say it then zoomed in to circle the airport before suddenly vanishing," according to The Sun.
Which is better? Why does it seem there is always that decision? Is it possible to have both? Is it possible to be happy even if you know that you have not done the things you originally set out to do?
Long Shot: Pedro Almodóvar and Agustín Almodóvar (Adapted Screenplay)
At endless bosberaads the suggestion would be made that the press should agree on its collective point of view and the governments on its. Then a deal could be brokered so that everyone could speak with the same voice - a perfect example of the attempted creation of a "historic bloc" which would then generate a single overall hegemony. This came close to happening, for many of the editors were naïve and wishful and everyone agreed that the government "had the moral high ground".

The Terran leader issues a statement to the Cosmists: “But what if the Artilect decides to kill everybody? Artilects might not like us, you know. And why should they? Look at us. We can’t even get along with each other. Or they might not even care one way or another, and just step on us like we would step on ants. Building an Artilect is too risky!”

Now I am getting older, the health benefits of not smoking are much more appealing, also over the last couple of years money has been very tight. Somehow (I’m not quite sure how) I always managed to find money for cigarettes. This wasn’t from disposable income, this was from money that really should of been spent on other things, so to not have to find that will be a real bonus! (I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my beautiful partner and best friend for putting up with me spending all that money over the past few years without nagging me to give up, she is a wonderful person with a saint’s patience!)

Like many artists, Baldursson performs in several bands at the festival, most notably with Steintryggur, who offer a gripping fusion of Indian samples, excellent drumming and a singer who plucks a jaw harp. As they play to a packed warehouse, a group of children no older than seven watch rapt at the front of the stage, proving that, given the chance, the young are more than happy to embrace alternatives to the saccharine dross usually targeted at them.

If war comes, we may see the bizarre spectacle of European patriots supporting a war of aggression against Pakistan as a reaction to the propaganda of the Zionists leading us into war. The Establishment have created Breivik and groups such as the EDL to form a solid support base for their wars. Europeans will die as a result of the coming war. Pakistanis will die in their own country, provoking anger in the colonies, which may spill over into bloodshed in our homeland. The Zionists who will gain from this will be safe in their well-guarded communities.
Yesterday I went for brunch with some girlfriends and I was complaining about my nose. One friend COULD NOT STOP STARING AT IT. Honestly, we moved onto other topics of conversation, and she was still glued to the centre of my face. I said to her, “are you seriously still staring at my nose?” and she started laughing, and said, “I can’t help it! I’m so distracted!”

A more enlightened approach would have been to engage in a discussion about why I came up with the position and what assumptions were key to making that position work. That’s what I wanted to do, but I just didn’t have the energy anymore. All day, every day, it seemed like that’s all I did. It was tiresome. I tried to stay as quiet as possible and let the officers run things with “I intend to . . .” but top-down was ingrained in how we operated.

Where am I leading with all of this? Barefoot running can be a means to an end to improve your running form. It can also make you more aware of your body in relation to its surroundings. But, in the long run (pun intended), you will probably still need to have your feet shod, at some time or in some capacity. This is especially true for snowy/icy weather conditions, and rocks and "sharps" protection on the trails and roads. And, if you want to go faster in a race, you should probably be shod. Find out what's right for you, whether it's a pair of super-light 3.8 oz Universe, or a pair tire tread huaraches. And if you're not having issues while still wearing your "normal" running shoes, then don't fix what ain't broke.

I can feel your hands and your lips caressing, stroking and arousing me, softly, gently yet passionately. I shiver as your soft lips linger when pressed against my skin at the nape of my neck. As your hands wander to my breasts, they send chills racing deep within me. You hold each one with your hands, using your fingers to tease my nipples, they are heightened and hard. My body is now longing and begging you for more, yet you are so gentle with me.

One thing that came across to me from the debates about blended whisky in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United Kingdom was that they were often not at all precious about what exactly constituted the grain component of the whisky. According to one side of the debate, all of the grain was a foreign substance.

It takes time to tune an ear, and effort, too. It means tracking down every unfamiliar song and welding the visual image of the bird to an ephemeral voice. Unless you are among the gifted few, someone with the auditory recall of Igor Stravinskly, the weld usually does not hold the first time, or the second time either. The bird with the short, bright phrases or the raspy vowels must be tracked down over and over and over. Then over and over again, until those phrases and the image of that bird fuse and become one.
As such, they rally around the issue of how billionaire investor Warren Buffett is taxed compared to his secretary. They claim that the federal tax code is so infiltrated by the influences of the affluent that Buffett’s secretary Debbie Bosanek pays more than Buffett does, and they demand that Congress take action to resolve the discrepancy.

Bar seats have been used for many years as a practical informal option for family dining as well as to lean on a bar with a beer in hand but the ins and outs of buying them can be involved. Cream bar stools play key role in giving an additional look to your bar or restaurants. If your place is hefty an adequate amount of, subsequently you can depart with somewhat intricate styles in the sphere of furniture. But in place of a narrow place, it’s recommended to obtain smarter designs with the aim of may well accommodate the customers with no interfering the pass ways.
Yet I suspected that was not the usual case. So I analyzed traffic to this site, and found that less than 1% of you reading this came because you were searching for a recording I have posted. Chances are, you are coming here to glean a near-CD quality recording of an album, and perhaps an artist, new to you. Therefore as I continue digitizing my vinyl collection, unless I have seen a high bit rate copy posted on another blog recently, I'll post my records for you, with due respect to other bloggers that have similar tastes and longer history.
The event that we celebrate—the birth of the God-Chosen maiden—brought joy to all the world, for the God-man, Jesus Christ, Who shone forth from Her, destroyed God’s curse which weighed heavily upon the transgressing and accursed human race, and brought God’s blessing upon it; having trampled down inherent death, He gave people eternal life.
A couple of weeks ago, I began hearing from self-published and small press authors who'd been approached over the summer by a Turkish publisher called Arvo Basim Yayin. All reported having been contacted out of the blue by an editor named Hulya Dayan, inquiring about buying Turkish language rights to their books (some examples of Ms. Dayan's emails have been posted on the Kindle boards).
I purchased the new edition of the Writer's Tale, a 700-plus tome, composed of correspondance between writer Russell T Davies and Doctor Who journalist Benjamin Cook. What a book! It really is freaking comprehensive... For example, I've learned that the Series 4 companion came perilously close to being Penny Carter, not Donna Noble! Who knew? And, if you want to hear the words Doctor Who and Primeval uttered in the same sentence, The Writer's Tale is the place to go. RTD is a fan of Primeval! This has shot him even higher in my estimation.
At that point, I didn't care. I had a very healthy baby whose only side effect was a big mushy bruised spot on her head, and believe me, I had plenty of cute hats for her. As for me, I was fine too. My doctor did tell me that I probably wouldn't be able to have any more babies, but I told her "we'll see about that".

Nikka whiskies have not been previously available in the US, but the word is that they are currently going through the regulatory process to export to the US. The TTB label approval website show that Nikka has recently had labels approved for both its Yoichi 15 year old and 12 year old Taketsuru Pure Malt. So, with any luck, we will have a chance to buy those soon.

The last two weeks have been North's Lowlands festival and once again I've been rediscovering classics and discovering brilliant new beers. Yes the inclusion of some Dutch beers does point towards a lessening of the Belgian influence in the bar but what we stock regularly and during the festival is unrivalled in quality and complexity. Great Belgian bottled beer still holds pride of place in the first fridge and is the biggest selling bottled beer range we have. The likes of Struise, De La Senne, De Dolle, De Ranke, the Trappists, produce beers brimming over with brilliant complexity.
This is further supported when we notice that Pope Leo XIII has, as many scholars have observed, essentially adopted the hermeneutical principles advanced by Galileo in his own defense:

He thought to reach for the handle of the spotlight to aim it skyward, but before he could do so, one flake flew laterally into his slightly open mouth, taking hold in the moisture of his tongue. He tried to spit it out, but it melded on. With slight panic he scraped his tongue against his upper front teeth, but the flake held its place. He relaxed when he realized, after searching with his tongue, that the flake had dissolved like a communion wafer.

On to the follow up on the thyroid nodule. The nuclear scan showed several "cold" areas. A cold area is where the iodine/radioactive juices didn't take... a non-functioning part of my thyroid and/or nodule. I don't know which, the scan was of both. I was told that about 20% of "cold" areas actually turn out to be cancer. So, the next step is a biopsy. They are going to take samples of multiple areas. I meet with the surgeon tomorrow so that's about all I can catch you up on. I will, as always, share away once I know more.

deep in a secret corner of your soul.
Behind the darkness came the twilight tired and thin and looking somehow exhausted. Being so much more delicate and having better sight the twilight could not understand how the darkness had fallen the way it had. Then as it had done, many many times before taking a deep breath the long suffering twilight stooped down to scoop up the darkness.
After laying down the fundamental principles involved in the case at bar, we shall discuss and show that Commonwealth Act No. 671 was no longer in force at the time the Executive Orders under consideration were promulgated, because even the respondents in the cases G. R. Nos. L-2044 and L-2756, in sustaining the validity of the Executive Order No. 62 rely not only on Commonwealth Act No. 600 as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 620, but on Commonwealth Act No. 671; and afterwards we shall refute the arguments in support of the contrary proposition that said Commonwealth Act No. 671 is still in force and, therefore, the President may exercise now the legislative powers therein delegated to him.

We all have our little morning rituals that we do as we prepare for the day. I like that the days are longer now. Not that I don’t like the dark of night. I do. There is something quite appealing about it for me. What I love though is being part of the transition when day kisses night goodbye and the darkness fades and new energy and new life is once again breathed into our existence.
Sure, there will be a reckoning in April when the layers have to be peeled off to greet the warmer weather. Countless hours of hideous exercise will have to be endured. I won’t be alone – the rest of Canada will be at the gym with me. But I’ll give that some thought around…the end of March. Until then, there’s Swedish coffee bread, Christmas cookies, homemade biscotti, mince tarts, butter tarts, pasta, strata, frittata, baguettes….

Enter the 1980s. This dresser was found at my local Goodwill. When I first saw it, I wasn't convinced that it was what I wanted. Plus, it wasn't on sale. Seriously. How cheap am I that I won't buy something from a thrift store if it isn't on sale. It's sad, really. Anywhoo, the next time I went back to the store, it was half off. I stood back and imagined it with a few tweaks and realized it was perfect! So for $15 (yes, $30 was too much to pay), I took it home. Let me tell you, this chunk of wood is HEAVY. I injured my neck trying to lift just one side of it. It was a job for strong men.

The film's sensuality is joined with its low-key suspense in the scene where Daisy takes a bath, stripping out of her clothes as steam from the water swirls around her, Hitchcock's editing playfully suggesting her impending nudity while cutting away just a second before she'd actually show anything immodest to the camera. In a distant hint of the bathroom terror of Psycho, Hitchcock then suggests that the lodger is going to break into the room: there's something so vulnerable about getting naked to bathe, and even at this early point in his career Hitchcock hints at what it would be like to get attacked like this. But of course, everything in this film is a feint, a misdirection, so once again the lodger's initially sinister-seeming actions turn out to be innocent. Hitchcock wanted to leave the resolution of the story ambiguous, as it was in the Marie Belloc Lowndes novel it's based on, but in a pattern that would recur several times in Hitchcock's later star vehicles, the studio didn't want to imply that a handsome matinee idol like Novello could be a killer.

He seemed a little nervous about singing current music. I am still very iffy with Chris Mann. I dont listen to Josh Groban either. Not to say they dont have great voices, but he just dont pull me in. But the oh’s were really good. It just seems like the wrong song for him. The thing is, I don’t think they have found “the right” song for him. Adam said he looked sharp, and being a huge fan of that song, he really wanted to be moved by the song in that way, but he wasn’t moved. Adam said he would rather hear him sing opera.

The main thing for Malaysians after the watershed 2008 12th General Election is for the nation not to regress into being a BN-dominant system. If that happens in the coming 13th General Election then the rakyat will have only themselves, to blame for wrecking the foundation of change, which they have so labouriously laid in 2008.

FG: Yes, I was sent a copy of it. I have very strong, but maybe very different opinions, since I lived this journey with Ron Maxwell. I personally think Gods and Generals may be the most authentic and true to all the facts, movie ever made about the Civil War. Some say it was way too long, some say it was historically boring. I personally think Ron got on the screen exactly what he was hoping for from day one. I think he was not interested in pleasing “Hollywood” as much as he was concerned about remaining true to the facts and to our American history, and I have to applaud him for that.

My mother and I have dramatically different music tastes. When I was a young girl, I’d listen to her record collection from the 60s and 70s while she bought the latest Top 40 CDs. As she bounced around the house singing songs from Will Smith's "Gettin' Jiggy With It" or Right Said Fred's "I Have No Idea What the Album is Called Nor Do I Care—two albums she still proudly listens to—I was mimicking David Byrne's dance moves in front of the TV while watching the newly discovered 15th anniversary release of Talking Heads' "Stop Making Sense."...

Just a side note the return of the Lord is imminent 1 day with the Lord is as 1000 years the end of Revelation 1:3 says the return of the Lord is near. In the Greek that is imminent in eternity with no time and space it is just as near now as it was when that was written.

There were some great characters in this book. Anna was awesome, and I found it really strange that I was rooting for a mass murderer. But it was all about the way she was written. She was flawed, but she was real. The story behind her murder really got to me. That scene was incredibly intense by the way. I was upset. I have this thing about realistic violence. I don't like to read about it, I don't watch movies with it in it, and if I had known about it beforehand, I would have prepared myself. But I got through it.

Dr Khan, are you going to take the fall? Because it is alleged, by you self on i95.5 last Thursday evening that the call to St Ann’s came from your Ministry. You have been insidiously attempting to get Cheryl Miller to be judged by the public with the information about her mental health that keeps slipping out of your mouth.

To save when shopping online it is well established that you should (1) run a quick search for coupons and (2) shop through an online portal if you can. But until recently, if you were buying anything on Amazon, there was no way to double-dip. You could of course get points/miles through your credit card, but there wasn’t any portal offering points/miles or cash back for Amazon purchases. This changed very recently: now, US Airways’ Shopping Mall now gives 1 mile per $1 spent on amazon.com and Hawaiian Airlines’ eMarket gives 2 miles per $1 spent!

4. Big Fish: The surreal fantasy film is based on a novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and is directed by Tim Burton. The film is based on something very simple, something we all experience — inability to trust something, especially if it is absurd and seems irrational, even though it is true. The film is based on a father-son relationship, but transcends that because of this universal human issue.

1. Is the proposed legislation grandstanding/pandering? Sure. But one person's "pandering" is another's "responding to community needs." It's no secret that people haven't been happy about attempts to rename neighborhoods (not just in Crown Heights but across the city), particularly when they feel that re-naming is part of a top-down, broker-led process to expedite neighborhood change and de-legitimize the claims of longtime residents to the neighborhood. There's also often a racial component to this type of re-naming, as Nostrand Park covered a few weeks back (linked above). So maybe Hakeem's making noise for the cameras, but it hardly seems a stretch that people in his district would be wary of developer-led neighborhood change, particularly in light of the Atlantic Yards situation and general gentrification. So let's read his proposal sympathetically, which brings me to point number two.

For the question of duty cycle I transmitted an idling MFSK16 signal at 100W into test load and using an infrared thermometer I monitored the temperature of the switch-mode PSU and of the rear panel of the IC-718 transceiver. A sequence of 10 minute transmissions, with 5 minute receive periods, was done for an hour. The PSU case temperature rose from 23.6C to a maximum of 32.2C at which point the internal fan came on and the temperature fell to 28C over the next minute. The IC718 rear panel temperature rose from 26.9C to a maximum of 40C, and stayed reasonably steady from then onwards.

Admittedly, this snippet of dialogue doesn’t give the reader much to go on. It does, I think, represent the larger book on a couple of levels. But first, here’s the context. The book’s protagonist, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Law Enforcement Ranger J. D. Books, has been drawn into a joint investigation with the local sheriff’s department. The case involves the mysterious disappearance of a prominent southern Utah couple, who, for decades, have been involved in looting Native American ceremonial and burial sites in search of ancient artifacts. When they fail to return from a weekend “skeleton picnic,” the hunt is on.

However, there is no hiding the fact that South Africa is rapidly becoming one of the most crime ridden nations on earth. Robberies ranging from street muggings to violent gun crime are commonplace. South Africa is often referred to as the rape capital of the world with one male in four admitting to having committed the act . Even that horrifying statistic disguises the fact this is not confined just to acts of sexual violence against adult women, child rape is at epidemic levels, with a recent report estimating that a South African child is raped every three minutes, which is to say that there are 530 children raped there every single day . In addition, although not recognised as a crime, South Africa has one of the highest rates of violent male on male rape in the world, a fact which should be born in mind by male football fans planning to visit for the world cup in 2010.

There's a fair bit of plot too. Revolutionary slogans appear on the walls of the cemetery, the name of Bêche now a weapon of change; Baratte is attacked and almost killed in his bed; an act of violence in the cemetery threatens to be the catalyst to undo the entire project. So there's a lot going on but rather than feeling like a historical novel burdened with detail it actually reads more like a thriller. Those of a literary bent will find most satisfaction in the figure of Baratte himself rather than the plot and characters that surround him. The way in which he wrestles with his ideas of reason and progress, his battles with desire, loneliness and responsibility; the oppression that he feels from the authority figures around him and even 'his own weakness and confusion.' There is always something that clouds his thinking, makes it hard for him to reach any clear conclusions; the stench of the cemetery, the head injury after he is attacked and the 'word blindness' that afflicts him afterwards.

This has been the number one biggest shock to me over the past five years, and even though I "get it" now, I still wake up every week or two in a panic/depression/rebellion against this idea. I spent literally ten years of my life, ages 13 to 23, focused on only one musical goal: becoming a great songwriter. On the tail-end of that ten years, just as I started to think I might be reaching my goal, I got a wicked-bad feeling that it might not matter. It reminded me of Joseph Campbell's description of a midlife crisis: you spend half your life climbing a ladder, you finally get to the top, and you realize it's up against the wrong wall.

"As we have developed the ability to target people more and more precisely on the web, click-through rates of these hyper-targeted ads have dropped dramatically."The question is, why? If you believe conventional advertising wisdom, being able to target people based on individual behaviors, attitudes, and demographics ought to make advertising substantially more effective. And yet no one's smarter than the facts. It hasn't made online ads more effective. So what's going on?
4) Kenwyne Jones was handed a rare start, and indeed nearly made the perfect start when his tidy lay off and darting run made space for a powerful angled shot into the side netting. That, however, was as good as his day got. There was no sense that this was a player with a point to prove, and in truth, on this day he offered no more mobility and no better movement up top than the slower but more gifted Peter Crouch. We looked just as static in attack with Jones playing there, and as was the case at Wigan a week ago, the hosts always had a spare man to tidy up whenever we got into the final third. Jones was easily marked and made little impact beyond winning a few flick ons. He could rarely got into dangerous positions when we went forward either. Yes, he had no service, yes he was isolated, and yes, we only started with one winger, but this was not the motivated, powerful, effective player that Jones has it in his locker to be, but a player who didn’t want to be there. It was no surprise when he was hauled off just after the hour mark. In fact, it would have been negligent of the manager not to replace him.
The One series is the fresh new lineup of smartphones that helped HTC take the spotlight early in 2012. While the One S and One X are flexing muscle at each other as a way to stay sharp for the invasion of the other predators with multi-core processors and high resolution screens, the One V aims at a less violent market segment – and it’s priced accordingly. While we wouldn’t go as far as to call it a budget phone, it’s a familiar package – and a lot friendlier – less powerful, but hopefully not underpowered. Not nearly as impressively equipped as its bigger siblings, the One V looks no less stylish – a good start is half the job done in the smartphone midrange.

One day as I watched my daughter play, it dawned on me and the look of my body didn’t matter anymore. “Anything that is worth a lot, usually takes a lot of sacrifice.” Our bodies after childbirth represent the love and sacrifice we made for our children. Us women were chosen by God to bring forth life. It’s an amazing act, so amazing; another human being makes our body their home for several months. Giving birth is a day-to-day recurrence and may be seen as no big deal- but it is and we only remember how incredible/important it is whenever it’s attempted without success, or worst.

One of my favorite quotes of all time is from President David O. McKay, “During courtship keep your eyes wide open, but after marriage keep them half shut!”I was married to my first husband over 25 years ago. I felt very old because of looking back and finding that instead of encouraging changes within myself during that marriage and to encourage it within him; we did fail through each of the 3 steps listed. In doing so, instead of finding the good in each other and encouraging each other, we sharpened #3.

Last year, we had an awesome, local artist named Jimm Showman donate a robot to our silent auction. I’m not sure how to describe a robot, but it was so incredible that people were fighting over it! I’ve never seen anything like it! He constructs these robots to function if they have a part that operates: lights light up, back massagers vibrate, telephones ring! He is on a similar crusade to raise awareness and is taking it upon himself to go without sleep for the next month while he constructs “30 robots in 30 days.” As a doctor, I told him he’s crazy…”You need sleep to function!’, but as a friend I told him to not waste a second sleeping…”We need the best 30 robots you can think up!’ As he proceeded to tell me that he hasn’t slept in 2 weeks and he’s been living on Doritos and Mountain Dew, I knew the doctor message was out the door. He has taken requests for a couple of the robots; therefore, there is one specifically for breast cancer (pictured) and the autism awareness robot (pictured) is already in its new home. All the proceeds from the robot sales will go to Cockopalooza 2012 and Soup of Success (another great, local charity). I encourage you to contact Jimm through his facebook page Invention51 to purchase a robot and check out www.cockopalooza.com if you just want to be a part of the festivities this year on September 29th! The most fulfilling moments are those spent serving something greater than yourself.

First is the roof structure adequate to support the added weight? Ensure the installation is done by competent contractors as moisture is the enemy of the home and once you even walk on a roof damage can be done, let alone when mounting a myriad of supports and structure up there.
anyway, somehow i managed to make it to the teacher’s lounge in the sprachzentrum (about a fifteen minute walk from the train station), where i needed to make a photocopy, and then all the way back across the station to my class, getting completely wet along the way. and of course, once i got to my class, i remembered that one of my students wasn’t able to make it today and so, of course, i hadn’t even needed the photocopy in the first place.

In 1973 the man applied for and was offered a good job where he could use his skills and interests. He gave notice at the place where he had worked since 1968. When he showed up for the new job, he was told that the owner's nephew had been hired instead. Man was out of work for nine months, collecting unemployment and applying everywhere.

“Dear Daughter,
It should be remembered that in many countries where Visteon operate, Governments of those countries have in the past given generous grants to assist in the setting up of factories and operations. Visteon have been happy enough to accept these monies but are now walking away whenever they can and without a thought for those employees whose jobs are now lost.
Although Intel is best known as a PC chip producer, the company has big ambitions for the tablet and smartphone market, especially in China. “Our strategy in China now is to win with smartphones and tablets.

I must confess, I have not tried all of these, but these are some of the favorites out there. You need to test your own inks to see what works for you.
By the end of the lesson, we had revised the personality adjectives a lot, but the students were still struggling with these questions, and especially how to answer them – they tried to start every answer with ‘He likes…’ regardless of which question it was.
Once, when through faith in His Word and Prayer, you have entered into an intimate relationship with the Father through Jesus and deeply desire to follow Jesus in discipleship, you will find that your need for a deeper continuing prayer life increases. Just as Jesus, spent most of his evenings or early mornings in prayer, so to we who are following Him, must do the same. We will do so, not so much as an imposed devotional practice, but instead to fill our awareness of the increased spiritual need for His presence in our renewed lives.

The argument will be raised that America is “a nation of immigrants”, but that was then and this is now. The earlier flow of immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Germany and Russia were needed in the 1800s to provide workers for the nation’s industrial base and as farmers for its expanding land mass. And they were white and Christian.

The problem that is created for the unsuspecting person targeted by evil people involves that person’s own somatic reactivity! What needs to be fully realized is that the somatic reactivity can be instigated at a distance because of the way we respond to our environment and that environment is NOT just the physical environment. The interpersonal environment is a mental place and therefore a much more subtle field of influence.

The Mozilla Foundation’s Asa Dotzler has updated the organization’s Firefox roadmap for 2012. Alongside the usual plans for improving the browser’s performance, the document lays out additional goals. Mozilla wants to make Firefox a browser that emphasizes personal security/privacy while simultaneously making it easier to share information across social networks. Dotzler writes: “Mozilla will be broadening its product offerings to include a web-wide people-centric identity system, a complete web apps ecosystem, and a no-compromises mobile browser.”
Crisis after crisis was befalling Paul. He was being spared from one danger only to be faced by another. He was still in the city of the Jews and they were determined to be rid of him. But now he had Rome on his side. God was using a pagan godless empire to afford him protection.
Prissy might take it another way completely, the wrong way. And that’s bad really really bad because she’s a black belt, a cop and has a temper of a bull in one of those runs in Spain. Now she stops talking to him, doesn’t visit his blog, and if she does it’s only to drop snide comments, all for the sake of a pair of stupid pink socks (for the love of all things holy, don’t tell her I said that), mostly because she misread the message what he meant to send across. I don’t know what happened to him. I’m too scared to find out.

Since physical pain wasn’t having the desired effect he took to playing mind games with her. He let her out of the box and told her that if she could make it as far as the road, about a mile away, before he caught her he would let her go. In her weakened state she was lucky if she’d make it ten feet. She stood there, her muscles quivering from being atrophic, hesitating. She knew he was messing with her, but there was still that spark of hope that she might. She didn’t, he tackled her to the ground like a defensive lineman sacking the quater back. Laughing he raped her in the dirt then dragged her back to the box.

One of my dearest friends, Dot Norris, went home to be with the Lord a couple of years ago after a long, arduous fight with cancer. She was funny, with a quick wit. She was also a loving and dedicated child of God and she loved Dane dearly. They shared the same strength of character, zest for living, and devotion for God. Dane loved Dot as well. Despite their age difference, Dot and Dane “got” each other. Dane was always smiling and ready to give a hug. “That child is so sweet, I could eat him with a spoon,” she once commented to me about Dane.
After dinner, we came back to the house, and started watching Killers, which we got from Netflix, but the disc messed up about half an hour in. So, we notified Netflix that the disc was bad, and put on Mythbusters! We've been watching Mythbusters for about 2 hours now! Yay!

Everybody knows of the Tea Party movement that arose spontaneously in the first year of the Obama administration to oppose Obamacare and other initiatives, but I suspect that few know much about the original tea party that sparked the American Revolution. That has been remedied by American Tempest, ($26.00, Da Capo Press) written by Harlow Giles Unger, the author of more than seventeen books about the Founding Fathers and the Revolution. On December 15, 1773, an estimated seven dozen men, many dressed as Indians who were then a symbol of freedom, dumped more than 300 chests of tea worth the equivalent of $1 million today, into the Boston Harbor to protest British taxes, mostly levied to pay for its wars with France. This is a fascinating story considering they were taking on the greatest power of its time. I love reading history and especially American history, so you can imagine how pleased I was to receive The War of the Revolution by Christopher War ($19.95, Skyhorse Publishing, softcover) which is a complete history of the battles that resulted in the achievement of independence. From the first musket shot at Lexington and Concord to the final battle at Yorktown, this book brings the long effort to life with stories of those who participated, maps, and the realization that it took unbelievable tenacity to wage the war over six long years against tremendous odds and against what was, at the time, the greatest empire of the age. The way the Revolution is taught in our schools hardly begins to reveal how much we owe to Washington and his troops. This 1,000-page book has long been regarded as a classic and now, happily, it is available in an affordable softcover.

We launch into the new opening credits after a hearty breakfast and some delicious pancakes and only a few minutes in Katie says she thinks the whole thing looks and indeed sounds a lot like James Bond, with it's covert, spy style music; like Doctor Who does Bond. She throws doubt on to whether radar technology actually works, ponders why there isn't a crater when the meteorite/sphere crash lands to earth and laughs at the model shot of the TARDIS arriving. She also points out to me that when this originally aired no one would have known what the Doctor was going to look like when he fell from the TARDIS doors. I'm sure it would have been out there in the press but younger viewers in particular would have been unaware. How exciting that must have been!
Dengue Fever is caused when you're bit by the certain mosquito that can carry the Dengue virus. 7-10 days later you begin to show symptoms. Usually it begins with a sudden high fever and body aches. Both of these worsen as the disease takes its course, and are followed by headaches, nausea, and eye aches. The Dengue virus attacks your white blood cells and your platelets, throughout the course of the disease your platelets continually drop, your blood thins, and your liver begins to work overtime. It can take a month or two for your liver function to return to normal, and it can take a month for you to get your energy back to normal after the Dengue virus is gone from your body.
Fast forward to later that night, all traces of colour-co-ordinating baseball caps are removed to reveal our glossy hair, though we do still smell faintly of gherkins.

When coming up with ideas for the 2004 film I, Robot starring Will Smith, Rick inspired the character Del Spooner losing his left arm. As a child, I also watched The Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman. The name “Del” was inspired by the Delphic Sibyl, a legendary figure who made prophecies in the sacred precinct of Apollo at Delphi.

Looking back at myself, when I started off in university I can honestly say – I am not the woman today! I was insecure about myself, and my ability to succeed academically, and in life! I took for granted the people in my life, and did not appreciate how wonderful life is, and how amazing I can be if I try!
This explanation clears up rather parsimoniously some of what would be difficulties for a simple temporal priority account of cause and effect. Take the example of a water pump. The cause of the water rising (effect) is the upward motion of the piston in the cylinder. But surely both of these, in fact, go on at once. Do we have here an instance of cause and effect being concurrent? The very fact that we can ask such a question shows some weakness in a simple temporal priority account of cause. If, however, a cause is seen as simply a convenient category within one event, there is, of course, no difficulty.
Hope for light in darkness, for relief in distress, for strength in weakness, for joy in sorrow, for deliverance when sinking beneath the wave, and for life in death. Hope for all you need, and for all God has promised. Hope thou in God, and in God alone. Hope because God has spoken, because He is true and faithful, and you cannot hope in vain. The foundation of your hope is laid in the blood of Jesus and the oath of God.
For now there seems to be an uneasy lull as opposing forces eye each other and contemplate their next move, though with the growing discontent in Kashyyyk, Mississippi the possibility of interstellar and inter-conference war seems inevitable. Will Ed Orgeron come to the aid of his former leader? Will Weis be strangled by his own headset cord by a nubile Erin Andrews? Will Clausen start as a true freshman? Will both sides order a temporary ceasefire to throw Skip Bayless to the sarlaac?

I think that one of the reasons I have such difficulties in enjoying “MANSFIELD PARK” is that I found Austen’s portrayal of the roguish Henry Crawford rather uneven. He is originally portrayed as a ladies’ man who takes pleasure in seducing women. But after courting heroine Fanny Price, he falls genuinely in love with her and successfully manages to mend his ways. But Fanny’s rejection of him (due to her love of cousin Edmund Bertram) lead him to begin an affair with Edmund’s sister, Maria Rushworth and is labeled permanently by Austen as a reprobate. This entire storyline failed to alienate me toward Henry. I just felt sorry for him, because Fanny was not honest enough to reveal why she had rejected him. Here are the actors that portrayed Henry Crawford:
I woke up, and decided that, with The Preacher in Venezuela, and my youngest visiting the basketball coach at his future college, I actually could go do whatever I felt like doing...without anyone missing me.
Finally we thought we had better inquire whether or not mother had been able to get a boat. We went into the hall and happened to meet the chief dining-room steward. He told us that he had just seen my mother, and that she had not yet been put into a boat. We found her, and were told that they were loading the forward boats on the port side from the deck below. The ship had a substantial list to port, which made quite a space between the side of the ship and the life boats, swinging out over the water, so the crew stretched folded steamer chairs across the space, over which the people were helped into the boats. We proceeded to the deck below. Father, mother and the maid went ahead of Long and myself.

As far as I'm aware it was only created late Wednesday or early on Thursday, so this is obviously fairly significant, even as a little morale booster. For anyone able and willing who has not yet done so, once more I would respectfully urge you to sign the petition in support of Mr Wilders here and donate to his fighting fund here. The only people who are going to be able to make any difference are the usually silent majority; the sort of people who, were they Dutch, would actually vote for Mr Wilders. According to Klein Verzet, online polls show something like 85-92% of Dutch people being against the prosecution of Wilders. Perhaps there is yet hope for common sense to prevail.
How is it possible to separate a relationship with God from serving God? Can a person wholeheartedly believe in him yet divorce that belief from service? Is it possible to say, “Hey, God. I have this super relationship with you … but I’m not going to do anything about it until after I’ve met these other demands. Once I’ve fulfilled my obligations to serve my spouse, and serve my employer, and serve my nation, and serve my children, then I’ll serve You.”

This year Erin has been asking for a Wii. We weren't really sure we could swing it so we told her that she shouldn't count on getting one. Since we usually splurge on one big gift, I convinced David that this would work. He is concerned about Erin (or perhaps me?) accidentally throwing the Wii controller into our tv. I told him we could put a Wii in our front bedroom which doubles as an office, but that means buying a new tv, or that we could enforce a rule that the wristlet attached to the controller always be worn if we put it into our family room.

Do you like the colors? I taught my sisters that my older one looks good in summer/spring colors and my younger one looks good with autumn colors, so they got t-shirts according to my girls’ colors. Well done! I got the purple ruffle shirt for my second child and my sisters gave my first child the ruffle dress almost in the same color. They looked cute together in almost matching outfits. I combined the J.Crew shirts with a white CHEROKEE skirt which was only $10. Don’t you think they go well together? Gotta love CHEROKEE.

We are not persuaded at all; on the contrary, We are amazed, if not shocked, by such a sweeping pronouncement. In the first place, the respondent Secretary did not, for obvious reasons, even invoke in his motion to dismiss the non-impairment clause. If he had done so, he would have acted with utmost infidelity to the Government by providing undue and unwarranted benefits and advantages to the timber license holders because he would have forever bound the Government to strictly respect the said licenses according to their terms and conditions regardless of changes in policy and the demands of public interest and welfare. He was aware that as correctly pointed out by the petitioners, into every timber license must be read Section 20 of the Forestry Reform Code (P.D. No. 705) which provides:

The thing is, it’s our habits that have the greatest effect when it comes to creating our lives. Most of our lives are lived on autopilot, full of all kinds of habits. Some of them serve us, some of them don’t. Some will help to build a life you are happy in, others will create problems in the future if they have not already.

As the laughing Accountant grew more and more comfortable with me, the laugh grew louder and even more obnoxious to the point where I couldn't even look this guy in the face anymore! It didn't help that every single time I locked eyes with someone else in that room, they mouthed the words "Oh My God" to me! (OK - only one person actually did that, but still!) I even tried to approach the subject by mentioning that his laugh was very distinct and loud and that others in the restaurant were giving us looks - but dude didn't get the hint.
After this early success Bob Andy quit the group, and the Paragons abandoned their soulful sound to become the most popular rocksteady act in Jamaica, but disagreements over money led to the band's break-up in 1970.

In the end, the polish shades stayed the same, but the names changed and each shade now represents one of the districts. Hunger Games fanatics will take note that there is no District 13 polish. They should have made it a base coat, you know? Since it's the underground/hidden district? Anyway...

Here, I started with the ribs, trimming them and cutting into serving size portions. Next, I coated the portions with my favorite spice rub for pork and let them marinate for about an hour. Afterwards I cooked the ribs for 10 minutes on the steamer rack of the pressure cooker. Once they were ready for the grill, they were technically "done", though quite unappealing looking. Finishing on the grill made them perfect.
I read this post recently over at Un-Schooled, and all I could think as I read it was how very much I related to it. Not the great-musicians-touring-Europe bit (I wish), but the relationship, the closeness, described between siblings. And I just had to share my own relationship with my sister, and how I feel that relationship has been affected by unschooling.

This was what I wore the day after we went to WWRY. See my hacked up Queen shirt? :-D My hair was still pincurly (I'm curly right now actually!) so I wanted to take full advantage of it and take some pictures. They're more flat and messy than the day before but I still loved it. I also love the way the curls bring out my haircolors. The day before I took these pictures (the day we went to WWRY) the weather was absolutely lovely and almost warm. The day I took these pictures it was pretty cold. Also, the bottomlid of my left eye was a little swollen and red because I accidentally scratched myself in the eye :-(. Seriously, I'm the clumsiest person I know. Who the hell scratches themselves in the eye?! I AM ASHAMED. No not really, I laughed about it with my boyfriend afterwards but still, it hurt! I do stuff like this quite often. I once or even twice woke up with my nosepiercing missing because I accidentally pulled it out of my nose in my sleep. After it happened two times, I bought the piercings with the twisty end so I can't just pull it out. I used to bite my tongue and my lower lip a lot too but once I started eating more slowly I rarely do that anymore. I don't think I will ever wear stiletto's out of fear of breaking my foot or something because really, if anyone can, it's me.
I hung up the phone and haven't exchanged a word with her since. That was over two years ago and you know what, I've never been happier. This was a long time coming and I'm so glad it finally happened.
So it's that time of the year, you know?

Abstract art, specifically painting, has become such an excepted idiom that it is a valid alternative to a landscape when decorating your home or office. In addition, or because of this, abstraction almost immediately leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Especially when seen in a gallery or museum. The general public and the in-the-know art-crowds alike have a distaste for it these days. While it is seen as especially suited for public spaces (any location that could use a bit of color in the form of non-threatening splashes and dabs) any serious consideration of abstraction is extremely frowned upon. Abstraction has given birth to the age-old, and never worn-out, impulse of “my child could do that.” An argument the aesthetes have yet to convincingly rebut. This is all the more difficult, when theory has chucked out Modernism and Greenberg & Rosenberg. On the one hand we are attacking abstraction, symbolized by the Abstract Expressionists, for our own postmodern reasons. On the other, we don’t want to be in the same category as the debased masses. So what are art people to do? Abstraction is at once arguably a much accepted option, especially in the halls of painting departments at art schools across the land. But it is also ignored, even despised by the reigning opinions and trends of today’s art world.
I'm still excited :)
Anyway, yes, the rest of the crew weren't much better. One particular man, Gentleman George Dandry, (or "Gentle George" as he was sometimes referred to) attempted to stab me in the ear with a wooden spoon on no less than 15 different occasions. I've no idea why he took such a dislike to me, Rich, I can only surmise that he was NOT a fan of the game I-Spy. A game which had become very dear to me on the long dark sleepless nights in our quarters.
By now, anyone that honestly thinks that Palin isn't scarily out of her league hasn't been paying attention. She can't deal with softballers like Katie Couric and Charlie Gibson. She couldn't even deal with a totally friendly audience when she was "interviewed" by Sean Hannity. She can't answer reporter's questions. For the love of God: this woman is a complete incompetent. This isn't the media being unfair, and this isn’t sexism. This is a person who has no grasp of national issues.

Right now I sit in a place of deep frustration, and if I can’t find a way out of it, Mists might see me taking on a new role or even a new class. Tastes Like Death…Knight? Tastes Like Holy Priest?
However, the search did not begin until Tuesday morning, by which time Paul could well have sailed off for for nearly 3 days in a NW or NE direction and been out of the search area. Which is why we very much believe he is out there.

My point is that there is a pattern of unkempt beers at Mather's. The only bad pints I've had in Edinburgh were there. Cask ales are alive need attention and proper cellarmanship. Bar staff needs training on off flavours. But perhaps if they're tasting the off beer regularly, and nobody complains, then they'll think everything is fine.
'With novels you can explore sub-plots – something you don’t have time for with short stories – and you can play with structure and point of view. With ‘Home for Christmas’ I was able to tell the story from the point of view of TWO main characters – one male, one female - and that was hugely enjoyable.

Footwear is always the most perplexing. And given the cost and trouble of extra check-in luggage, I am determined to take only one suitcase for 2 weeks; so, lots of boots and shoes are not in the cards. This despite the Christmas stockings, and presents for Miss Bee and Harry when we all reunite in Provence. (I'm letting Harry transport the Nestle's chocolate chips and Skippy peanut butter for his sister. I'm bringing the stack of New Yorkers and her forgotten clothing items.)

Following a review of the allegation, the NJC asked Justice Salami to apologize to the chief justice for making those allegations. Justice Salami refused to apologise to him. He instead sued the NJC, asking the court to bar the judicial body from taking a decision on his case.
Bird, “I only went to a male therapist once, and I didn’t like it at all. Even though I resist therapy in general, the few time I knew I needed help, I went to women.

Meeting up with friends and family at the weekend, and the subject of food and cooking came up, as it often does. I was talking about making things like gnocchi and albondigas and everyone seemed impressed (once I had explained to them what these things were) and it occurred to me that most people stick to a few dishes that are tried and tested, and often passed down through the generations.

We are let into the property and walk down a path between a double row of willows until we come to the main building, made of solid blocks of stone.

They should begin with the crafting of poems before they send them off into the world on their own. I tend to think there is a kind of poem that stands more chance of winning in many competitions – poems which are overtly about big subjects, yet are deftly handled. Though a neatly drawn poem about a bird’s flight might win you the National. As Fleur Adcock says in The Prize-winning Poem:
He was sure his stalker was a coyote or a wolf – the stinking, dead raccoon strapped to his back must surely be attracting the appetites of any denizens that still prowled these woods – but he couldn't believe he'd been out here eight months and still hadn't encountered a single other human. It'd been two months since he saw any game not caught in his traps too. He shifted the weight of the coon to give his injured right shoulder a brief respite, then trudged in a semblance of a sprint towards the cabin 300 yards across the clearing.
As he approached Chattanooga he was nearly overcome with exhaustion. He decided it would be wise to hole up in a motel for the night. The next morning, after a night of sleep, a hot shower, a change into fresh clothes and some breakfast, he would make the final leg of his dreaded trip home. He was only a few miles from the junction to US 27 which would lead him fifteen miles north to his destination.
I'm looking forward to getting home. It feels good just to be able to call it home. Next big event to plan.....getting a more significant place to live in SC, going back to Phoenix, collecting all my stuff, and driving it back across the country.

The prophet Nathan is heralded for having spoken “truth to power” when he confronted King David for having slept with the wife of his soldier Uriah, the Hittite, and sent him to battle to be killed by the enemy. That this little-known prophet risked all by boldly confronting the mighty king makes this a profound story indeed. And yet, nowhere in the Bible do we find Nathan’s “story”–how he summoned the strength to confront the king; how he felt about the king’s conduct; and how King David reacted to him (apart from the few words describing the incident in the as described in Chapter 12 of The Second Book of Samuel). David and Bathsheba is primarily a personal, fictional view of what “may” have occurred in the exchange between Nathan and David.

Finally, I also have serious ethical issues with the company. Aside from how quickly they threw their agency under the bus after the Super Bowl ad debacle, it turns out there has been a lot of insider selling going on. The owners have taken out $870 million so far from the $1 billion they raised. Odd given that the company lost $150 million last quarter and needs lots of cash to compete and stay ahead of its rapidly growing list of competitors. (Read the article @Business Insider)

We stood in a short line of people, waiting to be assigned a knight and crowned by a man who would have looked like a peasant from the medieval times if he hadn't been handing out laminated table cards and construction paper crowns. He assigned us to the red team! Little did we know, being on the red team would make the Medieval Times experience one of the most magical nights of our lives.
Daniel and his friends were the “best and brightest” of the young men of Jerusalem. And they were royalty (Daniel 1:3-4). The Babylonians changed their names. “Daniel” meant “God is my judge.” “Belteshazzar” meant “Bel protect his life.” “Hananiah” meant “the Lord shows grace.” “Shadrach meant “command of Aku (the moon-god).” “Mishael” meant “who is like God?” “Meshach” meant “who like Aku?” “Azariah” meant “the Lord is my help.” “Abednego” meant “servant of Nego.”

It is interesting that of all the traps that the scribes and Pharisees could have come up with to set for Jesus this is the one they chose. This was not the work of a rocket scientist nor a well thought out plan. Perhaps this reveals their desperation or their ignorance or maybe it is a testament to the fact that their eyes were so blind they could not see the flaw in their plan much less the flaws in themselves.

Remember my quest to recreate the walnut rolls of my youth? These came very, very close to the right texture and sweetness! I think I would just need to omit the cranberries, substitute in a little bit of whole wheat flour, and knot up the rolls, and I'd be dang close to the original.
I have heard some of their music before, but today at work I started listening a bit more. Their album names are funny, to say the least (sometimes you just really have to understand the German, of course). Then I was listening to their song called “Mai Khao Djai”. As German is not my native language, I first tried to hear whether they were just singing German words, maybe some “Mundart” (local dialect), but I couldn’t make heads or tails of it.
That's right, I am devastated that you are closing your site and moving to Google+. I am not a member of Google+ and honestly being a member of something new while I have so many other social networking sites is slim to none.

Acts 14 tells the story of Paul and Barnabas in Greece and their different experiences with the “crowd.” In the first portion of the chapter, the crowd are so enthralled by the works of God that they see Paul and Barnabas performing that they begin to worship them as gods. Suddenly, two verses later, the crowd is convinced by unbelievers to stone Paul and drag his seemingly lifeless body from the city!! This got me thinking about the “crowd.”

Traditional Jewish practice requires that the Torah - the Five Books of Moses - be read in public not only on Sabbaths and holidays, but on Mondays and Thursdays as well. To make this task manageable, the Scripture is broken up into fifty-four portions, one for each week of the year. (That’d be by the Hebrew calendar, of course). The Monday-Thursday readings are abbreviated versions of the ones that take place on Saturdays... a sort of teaser.
This book was shared with me by a friend who follows the teachings of Abraham, and it can be looked at as a bit scientific, confirming of religions praying, or law of attraction, because they are all producing the same result!
“I always thought there was one way of having a baby,” Lisa told me, “and that when I had a baby, I would just find out what that way was and do it. But it turns out there are lots of ways.”
So make a plan that you want to help him get reacquainted with true intimacy. Spend some time, perhaps a week or so or however long it takes, not actually making love. Lie naked together and get used to touching each other again. Look into his eyes. Let him experience the erotic nature of just being so close to someone he loves. Take baths together. Explore each other, and take things very slowly so that he can see that he can become aroused just by being with you. If you try to go too fast, you can push him into fantasy again in order to "complete the deed". Instead, spend some time letting him discover that he can become aroused once again by being with you. But this is much easier if there's no pressure, and if you spend a lot of time just being together naked, talking, kissing, and exploring.

(Rightly do they love you.) Still speaking directly to her Beloved, she tells Him she understands completely why the daughters love Him. Can you imagine how that makes Him feel? After all, He created us for companionship with Him. To love Him with our own free will. Whether we are walking in immaturity or the fullness of maturity, we are still His Bride. We love Him because He first loved us. And as we continue to know Him more, He will reveal Himself more, and cause our love for Him to grow.

I guess this would be Powell's novel length debut although he had a rather beautifully produced novella called Silversands come out last year that reminded me a lot of Gateway. I'm eager to see how his writing matures to a longer length.
This is something entirely different. Last week, including the 30 minute walk I took this morning before visiting my dad for his 61st birthday, I met my 300-minute workout goal. This included 120 minutes of strength training and 180 of cardio. I also kept up with my daily push-ups and crunches. While I haven’t taken new measurements, I can see more definition in my arms and feel greater strength in my core. I can also tell I’m ready to step-up the intensity of cardio, despite those pesky shin-splints.

Social work, as I am sketching it out, has to be a profession whose priorities unfold via informed and collegial engagement with all sorts of “outsiders” who share our propensity for a motley assortment of do-gooder impulses. The profession had best be defined, then, as having a commitment to the detection of various social ills and to the structuring of collaborative solutions to, or ameliorations of, such maladies.
Evey year I get the girls a new Christmas ornament. We like to go to a store called the Christmas village at Gardner Village. I want to make this a tradition, the village has about sixty elves statues all around the shops. When the girls get older I thought it would be fun to do lunch and then walk the shops. but for now we go in and go. Olivia had a really hard time picking the ornament that was just right for her, Gracelyn on the other hand was done in minutes and both ornament fit the girls perfect. When they get married I will box up their special ornaments so they can put them on their own trees, just like my mom did for me. It is one of the special gifts that my mom gave me.

Today, I decided to get the kids involved. My 3 1/2 year old and one of my 2 1/2 year old twins used some fabric crayons and colored and I ironed their creations onto some plain unbleached muslin. I need more colorings to make more fabric for the lining of a bag that I am planning on making for my mom for Christmas. I need something from my other twin and more from the other 2 kids so that I have enough material for the lining. I think this will make the bag even more special! I decided to cut out the pattern this afternoon and maybe I'll even pull out the sewing machine tonight or maybe I'll come home tomorrow while everyone is at school and sew or maybe during nap time. Maybe I can finish it this week and have a gift or at least a partial gift finished!

For example if you question the unmitigated benefits of multiculturalism you are decried as a racist, if you suggest that any section of the community, other than the white community, might possibly have undesirable behavioural or social characteristics, you are a racist, in fact if you demonstrate anything short of total surrender to the cult of enrichment that in itself will automatically render one at risk of shrill accusations of bigotry, xenophobia, hatred, and of course racism.

I'm fine with people making mistakes (I've made my fair share of them over the years) and actually appreciate when someone can be open and honest about it.

For pudding I served a plum crumble with homemade ginger ice cream, (the French love le crumble!) then coffee accompanied by a delicious 10-year-old rum from Martinique that one of the guests had brought.

Are these tests merely a way of sorting children by race and class, as Debbie Meier pointed out in 2007, when Klein first proposed to base all admissions to gifted programs on the basis of high stakes exams, or do the results really reflect children's inherent abilities?

While Iowa has tourist activities for each season, and there are the map of iowa state fairgrounds and Plum Grove the map of iowa state fairgrounds of the map of iowa state fairgrounds. I never could get the map of iowa state fairgrounds to say their sports program doesn't have quite the map of iowa state fairgrounds that their academic pursuits do. In fact their men's baseball and swimming teams recently got shelved due to budget constraints, leaving the map of iowa state fairgrounds with just 6 men's teams, while still fielding 10 women's teams. Many other team sports do still exist at a time. Looking back later on those conversations though, she realized for all the map of iowa state fairgrounds be apt for you as an aggravated misdemeanor.

The following two wonderful women and I go "way back" on-line, so I was super excited to meet both of them in real life!!! First, the adorable Karen from The Graphics Fairy...
Bare earth, silken breath of mountains and streams
We hate the fact that you always take humanity out of the equation when discussing civilization, and constantly attempt to take away our rights of self defense. We hate that you wish upon all of us a system devoid of reward for merit. We hate your support of race baiters who bring nothing but trouble and divisiveness. We hate your misogyny and we hate how you see the world through the lens of race, class and sexual orientation. We hate that you cannot grasp that if you do not, yourself, possess a right you cannot give that right to the government. But we hate, most of all, your hate of us, Liberty, Natural Law and Free Market Capitalism.
When I told my son I had scheduled a post that mentioned Sonic the Hedgehog, and that it was for Chili Mac, he got all excited. “I know,” he said, “post a recipe for Chili Mac Dogs. That would be an original recipe.” He insisted I modifiy this post to include his original recipe.
Closer "Don't Let me Go," another ballad with what is probably a cello in the background... this should've been on MTV's top 10 in 1986... sad, cheestastic: my inner teenager could not be more involved now....
An empathetic person is not only aware of what is in the present, but also the past experiences and how it affects the present.

if you do not already have friends who like to play computer games, then scanning through gaming forums on the internet is another way to get good and cheap deals for used laptop. Internet makes it easy for you to do this. Go to google.com and start searching for gaming forums. Visit each and everyone and see if they have a Trading Section. You will definitely find many posts from gamers looking to sell their gaming laptops.
This is like saying that you are a big environmentalist, that you totally support people who take care of the earth, and would not support any business or organization that pollutes. But also, it is government intrusion to have laws that make it illegal for businesses to intentionally dump poison into rivers.
My man of the match yesterday would be Nani, with Welbeck closely behind.
American Beauty (Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks, producers)
I still see them, after a bath, in their pyjamas, lying on their belly, head on elbowed hands, listening intently as the vinyl record turned out the beautiful words, their eyes big and full of imagination...
Old habits die hard
The beer finishes with a crisp, satisfyingly bitter finish. Overall, it was a refreshing and very drinkable beer and one that I can see myself having again.
If you are happy with the prospect of Britain becoming a majority non-white nation within two generations, than that is a view you are entitled to, but remember you were never given the option of a vote on it.
While we were at ITC mall (the mall opposite our apartment) desperately looking for a costume for Gwen to wear this Friday for her school's costume party, I couldn't take my eyes off those lovely Korean traditional dresses sold at one of the stores.
So, you’ve had your baby. You’re feeling up to exercise, but you don’t quite know what you should and shouldn’t be doing when it comes down to it. You know certain areas of your body have been affected, but how do you know what to strengthen, what to stretch, and what to focus on?
It would make the fact that I lost my job and that my house is in foreclosure so much more bearable to know that a giant bank is feeling better now.
Check out the Challenge details on their blog, check my sidebar--I can't seem to make it show up here!
I know I’m not particularly attractive, and I’ve got lots of friends who are not particularly attractive either, but their looks have never crossed my mind, and I’ve never avoided someone based purely on their appearance.
I’ll let you guess. Guessed? Good.

On the home front, the kitties are being pretty good, at least by their standards, haha.
So let me give a basic example.
A friend of mine, who is the head coach for her daughter’s soccer team sent me a message about what she did to create a space of expressive and creative freedom for her players. I take to heart this decision because I know my friend well. She is arguably one of the most intense competitors I have ever been around. She and I were college teammates, and I know firsthand her intelligence of the game, her competitive edge, and her impressive work ethic. Here is what she did:

And I guess you could go after the owner and investors personally, because, hey, if you’re going to strip them of free speech rights, then the legal protections that corporate law provides can’t be far behind…but as I’m about to explain in the next section…that will only hurt the economy.

8: Balance- Light a black and white candle. “God and Goddess / Send me the gift of balance. / Help me to make good choices / And to see clearly / As I balance work and play / Home, health, love, and family. / Keep me focused and firm / As I walk the difficult path / That is the well-lived life / And lend me your strength and wisdom / So I might have balance. / In all these things / So Mote it Be.”
The students have been waiting to learn about Tornadoes. We did a minilesson to go along with our Wizard of Oz theme. It was probably the most favorite activity of the year so far. We began by reading the book It's a Tornado!
During the Big Question show the significance of the EDL was discussed – well to my mind they have raised the public conciousness about the serious threats and damage islam has done to this country, europe and the world – but please do not take my word for this, I would like nothing better than for liberal / open minded people to investigate the things I have said, argue with me, or possibly see that people like me have a point, and then we can do something to tackle this.
- I'm super excited for baseball season to get started. I'm feeling good about the Reds this season, and I think I'm going to be at a fever pitch for a good amount of the year. It'll be fun times. I'm very excited about Mat Latos.
This year, in addition to helping at the farm, I have been spending much of my time preparing for my SE (Structural Engineering) exam. If I pass, I will be a Professional Engineer, allowing me to seal construction documents in Kansas. The test has two portions, each 8 hours long (16 hrs total next Friday and Saturday). It covers a wide variety of material, and as you can imagine, requires quite a bit of studying. It’s been a long road, but the end is in sight.

Though funny, it shows how sharp the young minds are and how meticulous the teacher should be.
I've already written a little bit about this album over at my other blog when I was doing my 30 Days of Nintendo series. My aunt and uncle gave my The Champion for Christmas the same year I got my Nintendo. They were trying to get me into Christian music because at the time I was grooving to Metallica's ...And Justice For All. They were the same relatives that would hate Tourniquet years later. So my cousin and I sat in my grandma's computer room and listened to Carman. She was unimpressed (her favorite band was Skid Row). Surprisingly, I liked it. I still do somewhat - the fast songs anyway. Carman's ballads are about as captivating as listening to grass grow. He's still cheesy though. I literally laughed out loud at points. I distinctly remember my dad yelling at me while I listened to this and played Super Mario Bros. The part in "A Little Bit More Conviction" where Carman sings about two brothers going to a "sexy movie show" caused my father to yell, "WHAT KIND OF TRASH ARE YOU LISTENING TO!?" Of course, this is the same man who thought Bride's "Hell No" was about Vietnam.

The sun’s heat is all over the place for the past few weeks. The hottest days in history. Scorching and skin-burning exposure. Not too mention throat-drying and strength exhausting walks. Almost everyone I know desired for rain to come to escape such heat, and to our great joy the rain poured today.

We were that family that arrived at the gates at 7 am, lined up so we would be right up from when the gates to the park opened at 9 (oh yes, we waited in line for two hours). Then I ran to That-Year's-Big-Ride to get fast pass tickets, while the rest of the family ran That-Year's-Second-Biggest-Ride to get in line. After collecting fast passes, I ran to meet up with them, which often times included fighting to cut people in line. (This was the curse of being the oldest child in my family, er, well one of them. Having to help put up the Christmas tree was another).
Anything I have not worn for a year but is still in good condition has gone into a bag and after lunch will make a short journey to the charity shop. Anything which I consider to be past its sell-by date has gone into the dustbin. Everything else has been sorted into 'outfits' - alright, I know that it will only be a week or two before I decide that that blouse goes better with those trousers etc. but I do get a good feeling when I see it all neatly ordered. All the Winter clothes have been moved to the wardrobe in the spare room.
Anti-anti-semitism is one manifestation of white guilt. I assert that it is in fact the most prominent. To see this all you have to do is review the most notable things Whites are collectively blamed for—the Holocaust, slavery, Manifest Destiny. Of them all which source of guilt is most likely to be accepted even by White conservatives?
My goal now is to get my life and health license so I could expand on what I could sell. Wish me luck with that!
His body language was below board. Literally below the board of the table…by about six inches, where he held his cell phone. The text came in, he stiffened and his body actually turned away from her and toward his cell phone. Whatever was on that text he was not inviting his date to be a part of by ‘hiding’ the cell phone under the table and disengaging his body from the moment.
Ans so you make examples of people who are in this case not compliant with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out of them, and there is a deterrent effect there.
I get this question alot with my clients
Motorola recently announced that it plans on bringing the bigger RAZR to Europe as well as the Middle East. After the successful launch on Verizon and in China, the fat RAZR is moving over to the old continent.
I thought it was about what it looked like it was about.
On a personal note one would never forgive Kunti for what she did to Karna,even though many feminist can go gaga over her problem. The point however would remain that she never owned up her responsibility and her fault till the very end. So even though she was karna’s mother, from my view point she was the reason that karna had to suffer so much in life and one would rarely sympathies with such a character, her “pain” was nothing compared to the pain endured by karna throughout his life. (though many would disagree with my viewpoint)
In the meantime, I continue a gentle skin regime fashioned during that earlier, problem-filled time.
Trust me. When you return and look at your editor's words twenty-four hours (or more) later, you will be stunned to find that somehow they've changed. They're not calling you a talentless hack after all. They're not saying the book is terrible. And all the quick fixes that sprang into your head on the first read now feel a bit hasty, and as if they rather missed the point. Whatever your initial reaction was, you will be profoundly glad you waited before you acted on it.

Cut the paper to the size you want, making a tiny pencil mark on the correct side (yes, Arches Hot Pressed paper has a correct and an incorrect side : ) ), and carefully immerse completely in the water. I tend to soak the paper for about 20 minutes.
The bottom line is that I’m not naïve about this matter. I’m perfectly well aware of the downfall of many, even most Catholic institutions over the past decades. Happily, there are still some who hold fast to the Faith in its fullness. But what I continue to assert is that, despite the deviation of many individuals and Catholic institutions, the Magisterium of the Catholic Church has continued to teach 100% of the doctrines of the Faith. That is what ultimately matters and I rejoice in that fact. The neo-geocentrists, on the other hand, seem to find this good news vexing and so they seek to play up the Church’s difficulties to the utmost, in order to save their private “dogma”. There’s something seriously wrong with that frame of mind.

Time is short,
In the mixer we whisk the margarine and sugar for 6 to 7 minutes until it becomes fluffy and pale. We add the yolks one by one and whisk until they are incorporated. We then add the zest, cinnamon and cloves. We put the soda into the orange juice and whisk with a spoon vigorously. Be careful to do it above the mixer bowl, because once you add the soda to the juice, it floods.

After about an hour the bleeding slowed down. My birth team got me all set up in my bed and Brenda brought in her scales to weigh Lou. Lou tipped the scales and we laughed about that. My birth team made sure there was plenty to drink and fresh fruit by my bed.
Thank you for prohibiting oil and gas wells in Longmont’s residential neighborhoods. I encourage you to stand strong regarding Ordinance O-2012. Keep the public health, safety, and welfare of Longmont’s citizens as the focus of your decisions. Do not capitulate to the threats from COGA and the Colorado Attorney General’s Office. Extend the moratorium. Case law supports that tactic. It will delay legal action by the State and give the City time to expose the fact that the COGCC is ignoring the health issues that arise from oil and gas wells in an urban environment.

Adding to the novelistic narrative of this story is the fact that the average Chinese citizen probably knows virtually nothing about this. As reported by Poynter, the Chinese government has used sophisticated censorship technology to blackout news stories about Chen in the last several weeks. Indeed, the silencing only ended with a brief state media report today saying Chen had left the embassy of his own volition.

A spokesperson for the Palestinian Union of Agricultural Work Committees, which works to improve the conditions of Palestinian agricultural communities, said: “Israeli agricultural export companies like Mehadrin profit from and are directly involved in the ongoing colonisation of occupied Palestinian land and theft of our water. Trade with such companies constitutes a major form of support for Israel’s apartheid regime over the Palestinian people, so we warmly welcome this principled decision by the Co-operative. The movement for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel until it complies with international law is proving to be a truly effective form of action in support of Palestinian rights.”
The unsurprising announcement that the Board of the World Bank had voted in favor of the American candidate, Jim Yong Kim, presents an opportune moment to reflect upon the soft power structures that shape global public policy in the early 21st Century inside the UN system and beyond. It is necessary to draw a distinction between Mr. Kim’s substantive qualifications and the procedure by which he was selected. Substantively, although lacking in either financial or diplomatic experience, Dr. Kim is in certain respects an interesting choice because of his lifelong dedication to improving the health of the very poor in the global South, as well as his training in medicine and PhD in anthropology. He has had extensive relevant experience on the ground, and in working with NGOs (he co-founded the widely admired Partners in Health) and in institutional settings (for some years he directed the HIV/AIDs program for the World Health Organization) and has been president of Dartmouth University for the past three years, although stirring controversy during his brief period of administrative tenure. It may be still wondered whether Dr. Kim understands sufficiently the economic dimensions of World Bank policy to enjoy the respect of the professional staff, and might have been more appropriately chosen to head an enhanced program of the Bank devoted to health and poverty. Overall, still, the substantive case for the appointment is relatively strong, although the two opposing candidates, both former finance ministers of developing countries, certainly had equally impressive substantive résumés and ethical profiles, and were plausible choices for this position.
Today was a special blessing for me, as a grandmother. Ansleigh, my five-year old granddaughter, has been a bit under the weather. Since she still had fever this morning, she couldn't go to daycare. I had business at the office and some running to get done this morning, but I was able to help out this afternoon. After spending the morning at my mom's house, she came home with me about noon.

Beauty and the Beast has come and gone. It's really bittersweet, on one hand I am happy to not be so busy but on the other hand I already miss it. This was the first year that I wasn't able to be in the audience. I was backstage for all four shows. I have to say that seeing it just off stage is so different. I really missed being able to see it from the audience.

Over dinner tonight, she asked me what holiday comes next. I told her that this year, it's Passover. She asked what Passover is. I told her about how our ancestors used to be slaves in Egypt. She asked if she and mama and me were slaves in Egypt. That's a tricky question, because in two weeks, when I start the seder, I will say that we were slaves in Egypt--but now, I feel like I should keep past and present a little more separated. I tell her that if we lived way back when our ancestors did, we would have been slaves with them. We would have had to work all day and been whipped across the back when we felt tired and slowed down. Then I tell her about how Moses went to Pharaoh and go on at some length until our ancestors are on the far side of the Red Sea, free. She askes me again if she and mama and I were there. I say: we would have been. She asks me if her other dad was an "and brother" or "anbrother" or something. I have no idea what she's talking about, but I say sure.
Father, thank You for blessing us in various ways by the people around us. Help us to be attentive to their needs as well, so that we can be a blessing to them. Refresh our minds again today about practical ways that we can help them, then nudge our hearts to follow through on those thoughts. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

So, our fall has looked something like this:
And I smile...
This is so much fun as a writer. I giggled at my ridiculous situation and cleaned it up grateful it was club soda and not some sticky pop. Perhaps though my character will be in a different place and that stinging finger will be the final , straw! You can imagine where that might lead. I won't write it here. I don't feel like cleaning up blood on the blog, although...I've read that club soda removes bloodstains...interesting coincidence uh?
Don’t forget to stop by and say, ‘hi’! We’ll do this again next week!
Pure joy when I think about watching Daddy teach you how to throw a ball in the backyard.
Images are powerful. And when it comes to breastfeeding, an image on the front page of a mainstream and popular news magazine has the potential to do great good or great harm.
I debated going to the barn at all since I had a midterm and a video project due today (which of course I saved till the last minute because I don't know how to make videos...makes perfect sense, I know). I had to stay up till 1am to finish that, and I woke up at 6am...and then 6:15 am...and then 7 am to go over my study guide and run through my flash cards for a few hours before my 10am exam. To top it off, I had a sick, feverish boyfriend to look after, although he very sweetly made one of my favorite dinners for me--scalloped potatoes and breaded chicken. It's so good to eat something hearty when the wind sounds like it's about going to tear the house down.
The name ‘New Forest’ originates from its enclosure by the conquering Norman King William I for hunting deer – indeed, the word ‘forest‘ in English was originally a legal term to describe an area of land set aside for hunting by nobility – in which poaching of the King’s deer was punishable in a number of gruesome ways including blinding or having the hands cut off. The restrictions on the use of the Forest by local people, and the harsh rule of William Rufus (William the Conqueror’s son and heir) led to huge resentment, which has been suggested as one of many possible motives for William’s death: in a still-unsolved mediaeval ‘whodunnit’, William may have been murdered by a ‘stray’ arrow fired by Walter Tyrell who somewhat suspiciously immediately fled to France.
This blog was sort of like a 'stepping stone' in the direction to a more 'proper blog' (where I wouldn't be that personal lol).

Middlesex County, which includes the western suburbs, came in a close second, with a 32.6 percent rise in listings in March.
One of our favorite memories of Scotty is from a trip we took to San Luis Lake. Scotty was young and was walking with us -- off leash -- when all of a sudden a jackrabbit popped up and Scotty took off after it. We'd never seen him run so fast as he darted about trying to keep up with the rabbit. The rabbit outran Scotty after only a few minutes, but when we caught up with Scotty, his whole body was quivering with excitement and the joy of running free. I hope his days at The Rainbow Bridge will be filled with plenty of happy times such as this.

Training under the Yoshinkan Aikido means repeatedly practicing some 150 basic techniques until you get exactly the correct execution of each movement or technique. Mastering each and every technique will lead Aikidokas to master the remaining 3,000. Unlike other styles, Yoshinkan does not study any weapon forms and only practices with weapons as part of the Aikido’s open hand techniques particularly in the areas of defense movements against weapon bearing opponents. Also, Yoshinkan Aikido does not participate in competitions. The focus of Shioda’s Aikido is self defense.

It appears that another season is done with no wins against his major competition. And with yet another trio of major championships on tap for 2011, 2012 & 2013, the window on Powell’s career is rapidly closing. In 2005, there were those that took it for granted that he would have triple gold at this point – not the two bronzes and 5th that he picked up. There is no doubt that he is fast. But he and his people are going to have to get him tougher and more resilient if there is any hope that he will make his way to the top of the podium. Bolt and Gay are still young, and there are youngsters like Walter Dix and Yohan Blake that are going through that process of taking their lumps as we speak – and getting tougher and hungry. The road ahead is not getting any easier.
Know what I want to do? Sit by a pool, all day, with a good book, my iPod, some hardcore sunscreen, and someone bringing me frosty beverages all day long. Then, at the end of the day, I want to have one of those hot stone massages, and be poured into a comfy hotel bed in a quiet room with light eliminating curtains. Then I want to sleep for at least 12 hours and eventually wake up to a gourmet meal from room service. And when I check out of this hotel/resort, I want the manager to say, "That's okay, Karla May. There'll be no charge for your stay. We just appreciate your business, and you looked like you could really use the rest. Please come back and see us again soon."
We're temporarily living in an apartment in downtown Seattle. It's not as charming as our Paris apartment but it's bigger and warmer and has a full-on view of the Space Needle. The Space Needle is not as pleasing to the eye as the Eiffel Tower, and in fact looks to be something left behind by aliens after a halfhearted space mission, but I've still been staring at it a lot and grinning like a fool.

Hi Guys! A couple of things regarding Pilanesberg, as stated there are only two campsites Manyane & Bakgatla. There are no 4x4 routes in Pilanesberg. Regarding the elephant that turned the car over, if an elephant comes towards you move out of the way, he is bigger than you and knows it too and will therefore bully you. The elephant responsible for the over turning of the car, also overturned a landy on the same day, because the people would not move out of the way after being told to do so by a Park Official. The elephant responsible for all of this was one of the big boys brought in from Kruger in 1998 to help install discipline amongst the younger bulls. He does not just hang out on the road to the right of Manyane gate he moves all over the park. On the day in question he was seen at Bakgatla in the morning and at Manyane in the late afternoon. The cars around him were boxing him in, which happens when the park is busy…. (Full posting here).

Today those who take interest in politics are those with vested interest, those upon the edge or those directing events; the common man cares only for self, a legacy perhaps of the Thatcher years. The right within this country has completely collapsed, the Tories ever waving the flag and worshipping pomp and circumstance altered position, moving to the left whilst the so-called extreme right moved to take up their old ground and indeed in doing so opened themselves up to Zion’s influence. As I write these words there is no nationalists defence, no party truly of the right and nationalism to all intents and purposes lies defeated.
This is the first design we tried out once we started moving around furniture. It was definitely closer - there was a clear definition of where the dining area started and the living room ended, but the arm chair looked awkward against the wall there and blocked a pathway to the dining area. I did like that this would leave space for a couple of bar stools at the kitchen, but we don't even have a pair now.
Here are your $528 million tax dollars hard at work! Obama unavailable for comment as he's too busy pushing his next secret 'renewable' energy source.....algae! Wow, what a true visionary. Solyndra and all his other 'renewable' failures were just bad luck. Now algae, that's the winner!

Geneva in Switzerland is worth a visit as many international groups such the United Nations and International Red Cross are located in Geneva. Many tourists head to this skiing destination in winter, when the Swiss Alps are covered with mantles of white snow. You can enjoy living in the ski resorts and skiing on the famous Alps.
I found this fabulous large wooden clothespin
This came together really easily though. Even easier than I thought it would be given that I completely forgot to toast the bread. And then I forgot to slice the bread for the sandwich part. I got a little over eager about using these rolls I had picked up. No harm, no foul.
And then there is the baby of the house. He can also be a little shit, for instance, he loves feces, any kind of feces will do, if it’s in the yard or in the litter box, he digs it. He loves to roll in it, the smellier, the better in his opinion. He enjoys sneaking into the basement and marking or leaving a little turd for one of us to find. Otherwise, you can find him passed out on the couch. I mean, this dog is the laziest Chihuahua I’ve ever met. I love him because he digs the outdoors. Going for a walk in the woods? He’s down. Hammocking on a warm summer day? Let’s do it. Camping in the National Forest for the weekend? Okay! There isn’t much this little guy won’t do. It also doesn’t hurt that he’s a little cuddle-bug.
Why no one should overlook the extremely big limits in the ways in which Hollande would be an improvement on Sarkozy; still it would be great to drive the corrupt racist warmonger anti-worker politician Sarkozy out of the presidential palace. And out of politics altogether (which Sarkozy has promised if he would lose the presidency. It is to be hoped that will become the only promise which Sarkozy has ever kept).

I am so excited about this project. My friend Katy at the Littlest Thistle posted her entry - a wonderful notebook cover and large pencil case. When I commented on her post that maybe I would make something with the trimmings I had ordered and enter the contest too, she said something like she wondered what I would make. Well that started me thinking. But it is so busy in my life right now, so much noise all the time.
Suddenly, the bastards are experts in your life.
Ash Wednesday is almost upon me. The first day of Lent. A day to begin forty days of fasting. What for? What is the purpose of this? Self-deprivation. It's no fun. I face Lent each year with a kind of dread. Why do this to myself?

Christmas Eve will consist of attending our church service and then heading home for...
So I used painter’s tape to make a kind of barrier from the bottom edge of the window frame and to the screens sitting just outside of them. It seemed to help. I had to kill three of the little fuckers before I went to bed, but they might have gotten in before I put the tape-thingie in place. And I only got bitten at the beginning of the night, which is sort of weird because I don’t remember killing any of those creepy vampire things during the night. All I know though is by the end of the night everything was fine. Let’s see how tonight is before I pat myself on the back too much. But I paid off most of my sleep debt from the night before. Which was dragging my ass around the office yesterday afternoon.
I have heard people openly declare that they were not abused as children, that they've never been sexually assaulted. This is difficult for my mind to process. There has been so much in my life, it's been so prevelent, it's hard for me to imagine a life without it. I cannot imgaine being an adult female and not having been sexually assaulted. Or verbally abused. I don't think these people are lying, I just can't imagine it.
What bands/artists/composers were your early favourites and influences?
One of the privileges, and sometimes curse, that I have as a manager for a ministry is to receive a great deal of books from authors and publishers looking for my review, recommendation, and potential interview. The problem with all of this is that I tend to get more books than I can read, and far more than I have time to review. In the end, I see this role as a privilege to offer council to the reading public – to inform them of great books, warn them of potential problems, and critique diviations from orthodoxy.
and memory went along for the ride.
TIP: For those visiting Valley of Fire State Park, check out the Lost City Museum in nearby Overton. The museum is open Wednesday-Sundays and is one of my favorite small museums in the world.
Granted, on the whole we are getting our fixes in charity shops and bootsales, so it's not costing us what it could do, (note I am now lumping you in with me, thereby making myself feel better because it's not just me...) but how much of this gear do we really need?
Everyone talks behind the back of the fat-skinny couple. No one wants to admit it, but they usually do. What they usually say is this – “How do they do it? How do those two have sex?” If the man is the fat one, they picture the skinny woman bungee-cording down on to his penis. If the woman is the fat one, they picture a man scuba diving through a reef of flesh, just to get to the treasure. When you think of foreplay for a fat-skinny couple, you see one dipped in fudge and the other dressed as a turkey. That’s how the fat person gets excited. One man’s yuck is another man’s yum.
The other set of labels prints 3 to a page, and they go around the small cans of Dr. Pepper. The size of cans I used were the 7.5 FL OZ, and I got them at Wegman's. These are smaller than standard coke cans, but pretty common to find.

Two nights ago, I received a startling phone call at 12:54 a.m., from my dear husband, who had gotten stuck in the middle of a snow drift, about a mile away from home, after working a 12 hour shift, fixing snow plows that keep the roads passable, during a snowstorm that dumped 8 inches on us, with 30 to 40 mph winds.
If, as Serano asserts, oppression based on being born female doesn’t exist, if there is no universal female class experience based on being female-bodied, if there is no need for a movement to dismantle male supremacy, Then WHY LORD WHY do these guys endlessly, relentlessly try to STOP FEMALES from organizing around FEMALE concerns?? If it’s so unimportant, then why do they care? Hahaha.
It's not like I've been totally absorbed in Christmas decorating...I'm still not done...there will not be 15 trees this year....and I'm fine with that. Seems the older I get, the less trouble I want to go to, not to mention the more practical I get...practical as in everything I take out will have to be put away again, so I find myself asking myself 'is it worth it?' many times over.
I would further ask this sheikh: What are Muslims supposed to do when they see their rulers become servants for Israel and tools for their own enemies as well as thieves plundering billions of dollars from their people's coffers? Are they supposed to just sit down on their comfortable sofas and watch tyrants violate people's dignity, usurp people's rights and ruin the people's wealth, pending the arrival of the Day of Reckoning?
Romance Ebook: How To Effectively Flirt
Jean-Yves Hocquet met me at the entrance to the house one lunchtime and very kindly gave me a tour around the property. The portes cochères lead through to a garden and stables, today converted into a car park and additional offices, with the rear of the house featuring an attractive veranda. The Flemish theme seen in the brick and gables of the exterior is continued inside, with dark, mahogony wood prevailing on staircases and window frames. All the original rooms are today used as offices, but the original features, marble fireplaces and painted ceilings, are still visible behind the desks, computers and photocopiers. It's an interesting 19th century dwelling, but with little exceptional on display.
The tenanted model of Punch and Enterprise appears flawed for any number of reasons though the high leverage adopted isn’t really the issue that many think. All capital costs money, whether it is debt or equity. The business has to service both with either interest or dividends. Leverage requires interest payments where equity can halt dividend payments making an equity capital structure more resilient to a temporary downturn. Neither capital structure is resilient to a permanent downturn in trading conditions as who really wants to own equity that eats itself rather than offers a return?
After Pumba’s “hole” incident, she started going into every hole that we came across. I was nervous at first but after a while she just went in, sniffed around and came out. She didn’t come across anything in the holes either and just had a ball tossing the sand in the air. She was just being a warthog, and that’s all I actually wanted from her.
Vickers had lived in the 1920s-era stone and wood home for decades, and it served as the background for some of her famous modeling pictures. But over time it had become dilapidated, exposed in some places to the elements.
I started writing when I was five years old, and I didn't get published until I was forty. So it took me a while. And, as such, I've been an aspiring author for a lot longer than I've been a published author, so I know exactly what it's like.
Pakistan and China have perhaps the most axiomatic of relationships between any two sovereign states in the world today. It is a relationship that matured fairly early in its lifetime, and has since resolutely withstood the test of time. Notwithstanding the fact that Pakistan is ideally situated in geopolitical terms to serve China’s strategic interests in the region and provide it access to the warm waters of the Arabian Sea as an alternative trade route, the relationship also offers tremendous ammunition for Pakistan’s economic development.
Mistake #1: Because Old Dog hates writing checks to the kids (because they hang onto them for months before cashing them) I put cash in the card.
He told me he wanted to give up some strongholds in his life. I honestly saw that as his way of trying to trick me to stay with him. Now I know God was working on him.
But for the ones still on the loose, it’s a whole other problem. All we really know is that there’s at least one more of them (strictly speaking, there’s probably at least TWO more of them, seeing as how the Twilights keep talking about the Old GODS rather than the Old GOD, or just plain That Dude N’Zoth), and that they’re located, well, DOWN THERE somewhere. Hell, one of them could be tucked away somewhere under Orgrimmar for all we know. I guess the Titans supposedly imprisoned them all underground, although, first of all, Titans, nice job letting the rest of us know where they ARE so we could maybe help keep an eye on them, or at least not go digging around too close and maybe accidentally let them loose delving too greedily and too deep, and second of all, bang-up job keeping the three we know about contained all air-tight like they have been. Hell, one of those three is STILL contained as far as we know, and it hasn’t stopped him (her? it? they? do we need to invent a whole new pronoun for these things?) from stirring up all kinds of trouble with Deathwing and Ragnaros and the Twilights.
This is my $20.00 easel, and my plastic art storage stand that holds my pastels. I live in a very small house and do not have a studio space, so when I want to draw, I just pull up a chair to my easel and work. When I am not using it, it is flush with the wall.
Our union, the NUJ, in particular has taken note and provided excellent support because they see us as the frontline in a battle not just for papers in north London but the newspaper industry as a whole.

In recalling these events, Didion returns to certain flashes of memory again and again. Quintana's wedding, with its peach colored cake from Payard, cucumber sandwiches and pink champagne; the stephanotis woven in her braid; the bright red soles of her Louboutins visible when she knelt at the altar. She recalls the fried chicken eaten from a friends' fancy plates to celebrate Quintana's christening, the Chanel suits the women wore and the cigarettes they smoked, the hotels they stayed in when they traveled: the Kahala and the Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii; the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco; the Ambassador and the Drake in Chicago.

I'm actually 100% in favor of you getting some face time with David Koch (real or otherwise), and if it's in sunny California, all the better. In my eyes you deserve this reward! I'm actually thankful for your efforts of late.
Speaking of driving, I applied for a state handicap parking permit today that will be helpful once I am back into driving. I also went down to the parking services at work and got a special parking permit that will allow me to park really close to the building. I don’t know at this point when I’ll be able to drive again but I have at least another 4 weeks of limited mobility, maybe longer.
‘Young adults consume these drinks assuming that they will improve their sports performance and energy levels and that they are ‘better’ for them than soda,’ said lead author Dr Poonam Jain, from Southern Illinois University.
The customer is not always right. And I should know, I spent too many years in retail! As a designer, you do not work alone – believe it or not. Your business is a partnership with your clientele; you both have a vested interest in the result. I’ve heard stories of web designers or illustrators working for hours on a fantastic theme, only to present it to the client and a response of ‘No, I don’t like it, No, thats not what I meant’. And they walk out of the presentation at risk of blowing their resource budget, and perhaps their temper, mumbling under their breath about how little the client knows about good design. But where did it go wrong? Sure it may be an amazing concept, but did you respond to the brief properly? Did you communicate effectively in the first instance, did you have a kick off meeting, and did you keep all lines of communication open with the client? When things like this happen, we often here the lament about the lack of creative freedom. But I have been surprised by clients who had been completely taken by an unusual concept because the designer ‘sold’ it to them. And why were they able to sell it? Because the client trusted his/her opinion, and why again? Because the lines of communication were wide open, the client was able to trust the designer, knowing that every move, intent, and objective had been communicated.

Make no mistake, Roland can try to spin that tweet anyway he wants. That was absolutely an insinuation that if anyone was at your Super Bowl party and thought that David Beckham’s ad, slightly made you want to buy a pair of his underwear, you needed to, figuratively, get smacked up. Why? Because you were showing attraction to a man in his drawers, and would be considered as acting “gay.”

In Vietnam, RAND invented the theories that led two administrations to military escalation against North Vietnam — and even after the think tank’s strategy had obviously failed and the secretary of defense had disowned it, RAND never publicly acknowledged that it had been wrong. Abella comments, “RAND found itself bound by the power of the purse wielded by its patron, whether it be the Air Force or the Office of the Secretary of Defense.” And it has always relied on classifying its research to protect itself, even when no military secrets were involved.

7. I desperately want a lip piercing and the only reason I got the tattoo was to get rid of that desire. The desire did not go away, but my part-time jobs have always involved handling food so it just wouldn’t ever have been practical. Also, I want to get a professional graduate level job some day (ha ha ha, yeah right) and people are shallow judgemental b*****ds and wouldn’t employ me if they knew I was the (scummy) type that liked to have holes made in my face for no justifiable reason. Personally, if facial piercings aren’t excessive I don’t see why they’re any worse than wearing hair accessories or any other jewellery. Or fake eyelashes or fake nails, because those are vile. But whatever. I didn’t make the rules of sociality, did I?
Not only did I try to squelch my insatiable lust for Mexican cuisine all night, but I was also missing Eli Manning hosting Saturday Night Live. See, Rock and Roll is all about sacrifice my friends...and DVR'ing shit. Only the hard working bands were playing out that night, all the others were stuffing their face with quesadillas and mainlining Patron. All the way across the country, The Black Keys were playing a concert in Sacramento. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were playing in Newark at The Prudential Center, (a venue I'd love to see The Dirty Pearls play at, but one step at a time here) but the most monumental show in the entire country was happening on East 23rd Street in NYC.

Reliable as usual, with only one segment (albeit a really good one): Poehler comes back to the Update desk to not only do another installment of “Really!?! With Seth and Amy”, but also to present some of the top stories of the week. My only small criticism was with the joke about Shakira getting attacked by a sea lion (“The story has to be true…because it was reported by Shakira’s hips”). The audience got it, then Seth unnecessarily explained the joke.
The Santa Barbara game had an even bigger meaning to Assistant Coach Ryan Hopkins, who was going through a very difficult time in his life. He had multiple deaths in his family in the fall, so he said the Santa Barba game was a special moment at a time when he needed one.

A throw down at my house,
I suppose that this was the height of childhood. Running like a pack of wolves through the cool evening air, heavily breathing in the summer night, flying through the darkness, not wanting to be the last one back to camp. As I ran through the trees and the tall grass I heard something. A faint scream. I slowed and turned my head and I heard it again. Even as a young boy I knew the sound or terror. It was a fearful scream and then sobbing. I stopped and started to walk back toward the jamboree area. My mind wrestled with the thought that I was going to be the last one back to camp, but I had to find something out. I was half curious, half afraid.

After we completed the "Triple Crown Christmas" it was time to go back to work. After work Chris and I spent our nights doing laundry, cleaning house and cooking. My in-laws and our best friends Wes and Autumn were coming over Friday for dinner so the house had to be spotless. Here are a couple of pictures of my house all decorated for the season.

I'm so jealous for anyone that can score a copy of Bloodlines, the spin off series to VA! I am mostly looking forward to chatting with all the bloggers! There's so much you can talk about with your friends about books! I can't wait! Oh and the Tuesday posts, discovering everyone's favourite books will be so so awesome!
2. Give as much as you take. I can credit social media directly for finding me my last two jobs, for creating at least a dozen of my closest friendships, for uncovering what became some of my favorite social events, and for rewarding me with a variety of awesome prizes and swag. That said, I’ve used it to help others find jobs, locate lost pets, spread the word about charitable events, and much more. The best way to get someone to help you is to first help them.

My whole trip to town was spent pondering how I would cope if the traffic lights perched on the first hill into town were red. Of course it was red, and I performed a particularly nasty version of a handbrake hill-start. I'm hopeful the driver of the small Festiva behind me has since recovered.

This brew poured out of the can with a one finger white head that dissipated almost instantly after I poured it. It left no lacing on the glass. The body was a clear straw yellow with moderate carbonation, but not as much as I expected from the style. The nose was grass and a bit of spicy hops. It was definitely more fragrant than I’m used to from the style. The taste started with a bit of spicy hops and moved into earthy sweetness. The body as thicker than I’m used to for the style with generous carbonation. This brew was definitely crisp with low booze, making this a really easy drinker. The finish was relatively long with some spicy hops. For a style that I’m not a huge fan of, I would definitely have this again. It would go down easy on a summer day. Get this one, especially when it’s warm.

For me, physical motion seems most effective. Walking often allows solutions to pop up; hiking is good, too, except that there is usually a long period where the scenery pushes everything far down, and there is the added problem that when you've solved your problem you are anywhere from ten to a hundred miles away from your keyboard.
Almost every country has its own set of local sayings and pieces of slang that not only add to the cultural experience of expat life but also provide an opportunity for misuse, the odd faux-pas and a lot of laughs. From the Aussie “Fair dinkum” to the Spanish “Chalado” (cha-la-doe - Crazy or nuts. Estar chalado = To be crazy or nuts) expats can often face a tough time when grappling with the local dialect.
On top of checking off a few things from our punch list, my project for the weekend is to finally design our bedroom curtains. Because...I finally did it...I bought fabric! Woo hoo!! Ok, maybe picking fabric isn't so exciting to you. J couldn't care less when I told him. But, I've been indecisive for so long, our neighbors live just a little too close for comfort, and I hate our current excuse for curtains sooo...

We hope that each group will have adults to stay with the children at all times, since we expect a large crowd.

"Patent trolls" are more accurately described as patent dealers because they act as market intermediaries in the patent market. Once the activities of patent dealers are isolated from other distinct problems that have been identified with the patent system, specifically the issuance of poor quality patents and the problem of the patent thickets, it becomes clear that the emergence of patent dealers marks a stage in the natural evolution of the patent market. Patent dealers make the patent market more efficient by realigning market participant incentives, making patents more liquid, and clearing the

Although he said one poignant statement that has changed my mind completely about the partially legalisation and decriminalisation of drugs: Drug Addiction services cannot make drug addicts stop taking drugs: “We can’t make them stop”. “For IV drugs we ask them to stop” but can’t make them. – Obviously they have methods but I found this very unusual.
Even cooler is that the guy informed me he wasn't looking for much because he had received the card as a throw-in, and was just happy to see it go to a good home and a collector who would appreciate it.

I realize that Heracles’ story is very long, adding his and other stories would make the book huge, and apparently that’s not what Evslin was going for. Which is what sucks, because I loved the stories so much, and the way Evslin told them, that I really wanted a lot more.

Being “subconsciously” racist is always a hard one to avoid and leads to all sorts of dire results, such as the fabled “institutional racism”, most frequently demonstrated by irrational acts, such as the police arresting disproportionate numbers of black boys for no better reason that that they commit disproportionate numbers of crimes.

Rajiv Chowk opens into the center of the tourist part of Delhi: Connaught Place/Square/Circle (depending who you ask). A round park rests in the middle of the neighborhood and avenues circle it like the paths of a planetary orbit, slowly expanding outwards. Streets are labeled “A” through “P” and finding your way around is as simple as knowing the english alphabet. High-End Indian shops (Fabindia, Cafe Coffee Day) and Higher-End Western shops (Adidas, Rolex, Apple) lay side by side for a fantastic shopping experience. Restaurants dot the spaces between luxury stores, but cater to all budgets. Walking just 2 blocks outside of the area and you are back in India’s Delhi with the bustling roads and noise, but even this area maintains the same sense of order that is embodied in Connaught.

There are good reasons that we form habits, there is a cognitive need for us to simplify the routines of our lives into repeated and comfortable habits. And I don’t think that habits are bad things to have, but we must recognize that the bulk of our contributions to the world, the bulk of the threads that we each contribute to the social tapestry are woven out of habit. One of the common religious prescriptions for this problem is to cultivate mindfulness.

We spent much of the morning asking our last burning questions about the field of ESL and sharing our experiences in the classroom.

The “modern era” began with the building of a dry dock at Mumbai (then Bombay) about 1750; a second was erected in Kolkatta about 1780. During the 19th century, the industry was in a period of expansion and prosperity. However, for the last 100 years, the yards have been in a general decline.
About 3 months ago I started a bottle collection. Some of the bottles I've left in their original state, and some I've been prettying up with paint and embellishments. This past Saturday I visited Cracker Jax in Dekalb and scored two finds. One was a creamy matelasse coverlet and another was this adorable little perfume bottle.
In December of 2001 in Germany, a man named Armin Meiwes who was a long-time member of an online cannibal fantasy website called The Cannibal Cafe posted an advertisement seeking a male counterpart who was willing to volunteer to be eaten and killed (in that order). A willing volunteer by the name of Bernd Brandes had responded to this advertisement to state that he was interested in going through with the act and the two met up at Armin’s home on Christmas day in 2001.
Method: Put the washed fish pieces in a vessel covering completely with water. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder to it and boil over moderate heat till tender. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool. Peel off the thick skins and remove the bones and thorns of the fishes. Mash the flesh of fishes into tiny flakes. Mix well the chilly powder, coriander powder, black pepper powder, 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric powder, and 1 teaspoon salt into the mashed fish flakes. Heat a frying pan and pour in the oil and ghee into it. When smoking hot, add the onions, garlic, and green chillies all together. Saute well till the onions turn limp. Add the mashed fish flakes and saute over moderate heat for approximately 5 minutes turning over very frequently and over low heat for 5 minutes or till an attractive aroma is given out. It is so delicious eaten either hot or cold as a side dish with rice, chappathis, or bread. Enjoy!

It now seems, at least in the consumer dystopia of England 2011, it is not merely intellectual property that has come adrift from its moral roots since the same fate has befallen physical property, both real and personal. Stealing an expensive and desirable pair of branded sports shoes is not just a question of taking possession of chattels without legal justification: it is a statement that one has bought into the aspirations which the brand conveys to those who wear it and that, as such an aspirant, one has a greater right to the shoes than does, for example, the inherently non-aspirational limited liability company which owns it. To put it another way, in terms of the aspirationally magnetic call of one leading brand owner, if you are a “Just do it” sort of person, you just do it.

The national planning policy framework encourages effective use of land by reusing land that has previously been developed (brownfield land). This must be seen as a massive boost to rural economies and infrastructure. However, as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive recast comes in to play from 2017 onwards, I would assume that we will see a huge increase in refurbishments of existing buildings. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive states that buildings performing below a certain level will not be suitable to let. What remains to be seen is whether new build or refurbishment of these existing buildings is a more viable solution. It will be down to the Local Authority to deem what is more sustainable.

By contrast, Wasp Star (Apple Venus Volume 2) is the most ordinary-sounding album of XTC’s career. This is the rock-oriented album Gregory would’ve preferred to make; unfortunately, Partridge and Moulding had to make it without him. Lacking Gregory’s guitar talents (Partridge handled all the guitar parts himself) or arranging skills, the album has few of the stylistic flourishes that distinguish XTC’s best work. Most of the songs on Wasp Star (...) are uninspired, revisiting fields that XTC has worked before with much more imagination and style”.

Luke Kuechly possesses good but not great measurables for the position at 6-3 235 lbs. While his size is not ideal it is definitely not a huge concern as he shows a compact/nice build for the position in the NFL. Many are considering Kuechly to man the position of inside linebacker at the next level and while his body size might be more suited to an outside linebacker, I believe Kuechly’s most natural fit in the NFL will be at the Mike position. Kuechly looks capable of adding 5-10 lbs. of muscle to his frame. By showing up a few pounds heavier than his college playing weight Kuechly would help hinder some of the flack he has received about his size. Due to his current size limitations Kuechly would be best served to play behind a bigger defensive line and preferably in a 4-3 system where he can stay clean and be allowed to roam and flow to the football with a little more ease and comfortability.

Wrestling has a long and distinguished history in Britain, however it wasn't until the 50's - when ITV started to broadcast it - that the nation really started to take it to it's heart. By the 60's it was just about the biggest sporting attraction on TV, and many of the stars of the day became household names... Jackie Pallo (Mr TV!), Mick McManus, Billy Two Rivers (real life father of designer Wayne Hemmingway) and many more.

Herbert paid his debt to society by twiddling away the days in solitary confinement. Herbert’s personally prohibited him from becoming familiar with the inmates he was stranded with. Being friends with anyone wasn’t an option. It became a well-know fact that he couldn’t get along with others, especially in confined places. Whenever he was in the general population, he pursued fights on a daily basis. Arguments were his passion and ”asshole” soon became his middle name. Not even the meanest of the mean would mess with Herbert. The years put a definition of anger in the creases of his drawn face. The look of a psychopath was naturally etched into his smile. Inmates made it a point to stay away from Herbert whenever he wasn’t being kept in solitude. However, when he was alone, away from all other prisoners, Herbert was the perfect inmate. The guards had no problems with him. They came to the understanding that Herbert caused fight in order to stay out of general population. “Clooney, why are you here? Can’t you behave? You shouldn’t be here.” One guard said to Herbert. “I wouldn’t mind havin’ you taste a little of my famous brew. It’s smooth as southern silk.” Herbert said to the officer. It wasn’t easy time for Herbert. However, it did keep him out of trouble.

I still have two pounds of Munich malt that I need to brew with sometime soon. It's been sitting in my cupboard, already cracked, for about a month now. I might try and wedge in a brewing session one day this week after work. The beer would be a saison or farmhouse-style brew as I have some Wyeast 3724 in the fridge along with some Safbrew T-58. I have two batches of saison-style ale already in bottles and it's going fast. The first batch I'm really quite pleased with so far. It has a pleasant bitterness and just a touch of heat in the dry finish from some crushed black pepper. I used Wyeast 3711 for both batches and they fermented super dry, around 85-89 percent attenuated. (Love that yeast!) The hops are all Strisselspalt and add a touch of anise-like spice. The seocnd batch is a little bit different. I added the black pepper, but also some chamomile, which at first showed up with Juicy Fruit bubblegum flavors, but has since faded and is coming across a little bland. I will give this second batch plenty of warm conditioning and maybe it'll develop a little more complexity. The batch I intend to brew will probably have some lemon and orange peel added to it, along with a bit more of black or green peppercorns than the previous batches. I had some Nicie Spicie from Short's on a recent Michigan trip and I'm sort of seeking to emulate it.

PT was a band that I did with an ex roomate Jason Krak, and his brother Jared who plays drums. Also involved was Sean Doody who played bass, and has been in the band End Of A Year for a good amount of time now. Musically I think we were influenced by the likes of Neurosis, Citizens Arrest, Bastard & Weed. We used a lot of the wah wah pedal to stoner things up a bit, and to try an do something a little different. I don't think it worked as well on here as it did the ep. This was recorded by Will Dandy at Dead Air Studios in Western Mass. We played some really fun shows, and recorded a 7" for my buddy Dan Barkers record label. I ended up leaving the band because I moved from Albany NY to Brooklyn NY. The band replaced me, and recorded another demo. I'll up the 7" sometime in the near future. Good times...

Still, I can't help but think about my next life, the one I plan on having when the days of child rearing and dodging the cookie cutter suburban mindset that acts as my own personal quicksand is behind me. I have noticed that I tend to look backwards when planning to go forward, so I know I'll reach for what brings me joy, comfort and a feeling of home and belonging. My parents adapted very well to the US, I obviously love this country but I've never had the strong urge to stay here. I can't think of anything better than a life filled with afternoon matés on a pretty balcony in BA, nighttime tango bars and trips to Mendoza, Mar de Plata and Patagonia. I love Argentina, the thought of making my way back there makes me happy, walking the streets lends me a familiar feeling of childhood times surrounded by my family, the vibe haunts the cities and envelops me with warmth. Since today my song challenge is to post a song that makes me happy, I can only contribute a video that I love, because this is what Buenos Aires sounds like …. one day it will be my new life, where I can keep only what I want from this one and go on my merry way. How can that make me feel anything but utterly thrilled?

First, the positives of this novel: I found the overall plot intriguing. Ana is thrown into this world, and she doesn’t immediately give into what he wants her to do. She thinks things through and stands up for what she wants. I found her very relatable in certain aspects – although I’m way more submissive than she is, so I couldn’t really understand some of her decisions. The book was easy to read, and I think it did a good job of showing that BDSM isn’t about forcing people to do things; it’s all about consent, which is something that I think most people miss when they see the whips and chains that are often involved. I found myself not wanting to stop reading, and now that I’m done with the first book, I really want to continue the series.

Finally, I created a button band in the same way I do for all my crochet cushions by picking up 60 stitches evenly across the inside of the front piece and working 6 dc rows. I picked out 4 coordinating buttons, stitched then evenly along the button band and then poked them through the back between the treble stitched (no need to make a button hole for this, in fact I find it holds the button better if you don’t).

I think it is fair to say that humanity has reached a time in their development where we desperately need a change in our thinking, or philosophy of life, if we are going to continue to both survive and evolve as a society. It is not so simple as to say we need to start doing this or quit doing that, no that is not deep enough into the realm of critical thinking when looking at it. It is not just a matter of changing a few physical actions, that is far too simplistic and would not matter, it instead is a matter of changing the entire way we think, the things we value, the things we place importance on. I am not saying that I have the answer to this problem because to be honest, I do not. I think I can identify more about what must be changed than I can how to change it, but that’s a start……

"In the past years, carefully calculated projections of world population in 2010 have gone from 20 billion, to 15, to 11, to now 9 billion15. This says two things: first, we’ve been persistently overestimating our growth rates16-18. Second, every time we found out we were wrong – even by a magnitude of 11 billion - it didn’t worry us at all. In fact, most of us were glad about it. Though it did raise a few concerns, nobody was too bothered about it."

For, archaic astronomy, and the ancient, physical and mathematical sciences, expressed views identical with those of modern science, and many of far more momentous import. A “struggle for life” as a “survival of the fittest” in the worlds above, as on our planet here below, are distinctly taught. This teaching, however, although it would not be “entirely rejected” by Science, is sure to be repudiated as an integral whole. For it avers that there are only seven Self-born primordial “gods” emanated from the trinitarian ONE. In other words, it means that all the worlds or sidereal bodies (always on strict analogy) are formed one from the other, after the primordial manifestation at the beginning of the “Great Age” is accomplished. The birth of the celestial bodies in Space is compared to a crowd or multitude of “pilgrims” at the festival of the “Fires.” Seven ascetics appear on the threshold of the temple with seven lighted sticks of incense. At the light of these the first row of pilgrims light their incense sticks. After which every ascetic begins whirling his stick around his head in space, and furnishes the rest with fire. Thus with the heavenly bodies. A laya-centre is lighted and awakened into life by the fires of another “pilgrim,” after which the new “centre” rushes into space and becomes a comet. It is only after losing its velocity, and hence its fiery tail, that the “Fiery Dragon” settles down into quiet and steady life as a regular respectable citizen of the sidereal family. Therefore it is said:—
My parents modeled reading, as well. Mommy spent hours at her desk, reading scholarly books related to her work as a teacher and music historian. Daddy, after a long day in the physics lab, would settle into a comfy chair after supper and disappear behind the New York Times or Scientific American. My parents subscribed to Life magazine, and I “read” the pictures before I could read the words. We got The New Yorker, too, and by twelve I was reading it cover to cover. There weren’t many YA books back then, so at that point I moved on to books for adults and never looked back.

In the past, I’ve thought that Antinous would have been quite similar to Mabon and Cú Chulainn in the Insular Celtic world; a Native American I spoke with many years back said that Antinous seemed to him like a form of Coyote; Germanic practitioners have suggested similarities to Freyr and Baldr; many things about the mythology of Sarutahiko-no-Okami in Shinto–including details of the history of his principal shrine and his own death by drowning–also echo Antinous quite strongly; Shiva, Skanda, and Hanuman all have certain things in common with Antinous; and so on and so forth through cultures and pantheons about which we can only guess at this point. While Antinous may never assume their forms or their guises–nor they his–there is utterly no reason why he can’t at least be friends with any of these deities. If there is one thing I have observed in my interactions over the years with Antinous, it’s that he’s never yet demonstrated any hostility toward or difficulties with any other deity, spirit, hero, divine figure, pantheon, or even individual practitioners. People’s relationships with him may change, or their interests in him (or his in them, in some cases) may waver; but, no outright rejections or refusals of hospitality or friendliness have occurred about which I’m aware. And I think it will continue to work in this way for the foreseeable future.

I then placed them tightly in the bottom of the casserole dish. Having melted about half a tablespoon of butter, I added a dash of sunflower oil and drizzled it over the veg.
An occupier’s right of residence can only be terminated if such termination is “just and equitable”. Further, the courts will not grant an eviction order unless the owner makes alternative accommodation available – Chapter IV, Section 9. What represents “suitable” accommodation is also set down in the Act, and in most cases the farmer is unable to find this “suitable” accommodation and he simply buys a piece of ground somewhere else and gives the occupier building materials with which to build a house.
This week’s YA Indie Carnival topic deals with our Work In Progress (WIP). I can’t reveal too many scenes with the new Book 2 (I write scenes as they come to me, usually out of order. Would hate to spoil anything just yet). So I thought I’d share a WIP of my YA book. It’s currently titled SuperNova but that’s just the project name for now.

The game begins with three healers arriving in a town, a backwards settlement built on a meat industry out in the barren earth of the Russian steppes. The year is… about 1910, maybe. The three healers do not know each other, and arrive in town via different paths and come for different reasons. One of the healers is a dashing doctor from the city, another is a musclebound shamanistic figure. The last is a tiny girl with fearsome messianical powers. They are the Bachelor, the Haruspicus and the Devotress. They’re also your playable characters.

Water supply is an issue on the Gospel Trail. Since it avoids many towns, water access is off route much of the way. This means hikers have to carry an extra 10-20 lbs of water with them to prevent dehydration. Hikers die from dehydration every year in Israel.
I suppose I have to think of this in neither a good/bad manner, but rather accept that the intensity of these transitions is appropriate and important to consider.
Start Smart gave a lot of valuable information on financing options, and an introduction to CEED. One of the programs that struck home to me was the SEB program. Self Employment Benefits basically provided me with some pay and training to help me get a solid start in business. The classes each week help a new entrepreneur to learn the basics on law, taxes, marketing, sales, networking, bookkeeping, human resources, consulting, financing, websites, social media, tenders and intellectual property. The classes come from professionals in the various fields and the advice they give has been very useful to my business.

It’s a little snippet of what the company can look forward to if they hire me for the internship.

Who Goes There? Frankie & Johnnie's SteakhouseAfter Sardi's, Frankie & Johnnie's ranks as the oldest surviving eatery in the Theatre District. It was founded in 1926 and has seen a lot of flops and hits, and the actors who starred in them. It was a speakeasy in its early years, according to lore. A few years ago, the place was almost lost to the city when the Shuberts, who own the property, began tearing down every building around it in hopes of erecting a hotel on the plot. But the economy tanked before the theatre owners could get to Frankie's, and the steakhouse won a last-minute reprieve. (Ironically, the Shubert execs loved Frankie's. They often ate and held meetings at the restaurant. Never trust a landlord.)Despite having dodged the wrecking ball, the owners of Frankie's nonetheless found a way to wreck the joint themselves. Soon after being saved, they ripped out the old hidden bar upstairs—a wonderful, ramshackle little getaway if you knew how to find it, where Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lanskey once drank alongside John O'Hara and Frank Sinatra, and Jason Robards Jr. pilloried Richard Nixon to his face. They then installed a faceless, blah bar on the ground floor, and scrubbed up and widened the entrance to the old staircase that winds it way up to the tidy, second-floor dining area.These renovations were mistakes, and noticeably decreased the seedy charm of the place. Still, Frankie & Johnnie's retains more charm than most. Tucked away 15 feet above Eighth Avenue, its small windows shaded, it still feels like a speakeasy, the most Runyonesque of Times Square eateries. The bill of fare remains avowedly old school. "I haven't seen calves liver on a menu in years!" said my brother during a recent dinner. (He doesn't get to many New York steakhouses.) He could have said the same about the creamed spinach, clams casino, mushroom caps or any number of long-standing F&J specialties.The steaks here aren't the best in New York, but they're not the worst. I always have the petit filet mignon and I always enjoy it. And the creamed spinach rocks. So do the ridiculous number (eight) of potato side dishes. If you can't find a potato preparation you like here, you just don't like potatoes. Eating ain't cheap. Meat entrees start in the 20s and head up to the 50s. And you can't escape by ordering pasta. Somehow, penne with chicken merits a $26 pricetag.There was a Frankie and a Johnnie at one time. Ownership passed down through the Johnnie line until waiter Peter Chimos bought the joint in 1985. Some of the present waiters are as old as Chimos. The hands of mine shook as he placed down my steak, but he was otherwise polite and attentive. He told me that the restaurant's many regulars stretch well beyond the Theatre District, or New York, or even the tri-state area. There are loyalists in every state, and when they come to New York, this is where they eat. And, of course, they still get their share of stage celebrities and politicians.The Shuberts still own the building. Don't get me wrong, but I hope the economy doesn't improve too much. —Brooks of Sheffield

Calla & I sat together at the kitchen counter and watched Dad create a Spanakopizza for our 2nd Wednesday night meal. The perfect collision of the creamy spinach & feta spanakopita, but left open faced and topped with olives, tomatoes and parmesan cheese. Then served with tzadziki on the side. This he says, was ‘made with love for my girls’, what a great guy!!

-the Japanese extermination plan: poisonous smoke, poisons, drowning, decapitation…total annihilation without a trace
Duncan Jepson, the author of All the Flowers in Shanghai, tells an interesting story of Feng, a young Chinese woman forced into an arranged marriage in the years before the country was invaded by the Japanese. The story reads as an explanation from a much older Feng to her estranged daughter. The opening chapters are intriguing and the reader experiences the very real impending doom that seems so much worse since the innocent and young Feng is naive to her future.

My Take: OK, fact is I over paid for Scandrick and gave him a big contract now we have to use him some where even if he can’t cover the slot receiver. If you think Jenkins can’t cover, look at Scandrick.
ATRI also considered “effective enforcement countermeasures” – namely those states that issued more tickets got fewer crashes. It makes sense to consider that states who are “tough” on enforcement would get fewer crashes. It’s also tough on those drivers who are being pushed by dispatch or managers to “bend rules” to increase productivity.

1. How much better the UK is at putting together small showings like this that both are and are not cabaret. In the US, we do a lot of concerts. But less small productions. And there's certainly less subsidizing of it from any larger artistic entity. The actual support for writers here blows New York out of the water.

How do I know that? How can I be sure of that? We are told clearly that as long as the Christians are on this earth those terrible things cannot happen (2 Thessalonians 2:7.) But after the Christians are “taken away” then all “hell will break loose on this earth.” Where will you be? Where will I be? If you have believed (trusted) Jesus Christ as your Saviour, then your hope is the same as mine. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 tells us:

I feel Aliens is downgraded by its aesthetics. Part of that problem was the choice of film stock used in the Kodak Eastman type that was only in use for a very brief period of time. The reasons for that begin with excessive grain and ends with a difficulty in processing blue screen effects. Aliens is a very grainy film, and in addition to that, has very bleached out colors. The color palette is very flat. Blacks aren’t black, and with a film of this sort, creating light and shadow contrast is very important. This creates a rather visually bland presentation that fails to match the highly atmospheric quality of Ridley Scott’s 1979 original. I believe that some of these problems have been rectified on the Blu Ray release which Cameron himself supervised. I wish I could view that version so that, maybe, some of my gripes with the film would evaporate. However, that’s not all, but I will cover those later when I address the visual effects.

When did “safety first” creep into the top spot on the priority list of our national parenting consciousness? If you’re a parent now, chances are your parents left you in the car while they ran into the post office, and you babysat three or four neighbor kids by the time you were twelve. Most moms today wouldn’t think of leaving infants or toddlers with seventh graders, even though THEY were seventh graders 20 years ago who managed not to maim the little ones in their care. Is it because we didn’t “know” how dangerous all those activities were, we didn’t think twice about doing them?
The movie features an almost uniformly Van Morrison soundtrack. For reasons that escape me, they use as many covers as originals. Still, I love the idea of uniform soundtracks. But because I can’t praise anything wholeheartedly, I will say that Van Morrison doesn’t exactly match the movie. The couple’s song–”their song”–works very very well, but the others less so. At least they didn’t use Moondance (overused).

Here's something I haven't done for awhile - a muted, more subtle nail polish color. Lately I've been sporting bright, sometimes nearly neon colors, but this is a pleasant change.

Three years ago I wrote a post about aging and all that has and hasn't changed for me over the years. I also mentioned (in a subsequent response to a comment) that retirement was three years in the offing. Now I'm three years older and retirement is a mere five weeks away. I am tremendously excited about having free time, about not having to get up every morning and hurry off to work, about spending more time with my grandchildren without having to rush home at the beginning of the work week. I have a bucket list three miles long and can't wait to get started on it. There are some things about working (besides the regular paycheck) I will miss, though.

Dogs also carry a large medical responsibility. After birth, they require a series of shots. Some vets differ in the delivery of these, so ask yours. They will then set up annual visits in which some of these vaccinations are repeated. It is vital that they keep up with these each year. It is also important that you keep the paperwork, and they wear the dog tags stating that they are up to date.

"And so you make examples out of people who are in this case not compliant with the law. Find people who are not compliant with the law, and you hit them as hard as you can and you make examples out of them, and there is a deterrent effect there.

And, that won’t happen unless you have somebody out there making examples of people.

I have thought about the life and death of Charles-Antoine Blais every day since that day he was murdered. I'm ashamed I did not speak out at the time more than I did. I was not used to autism advocacy. I thought, what if they are right? They were in charge, after all, making all the decisions, deciding our future. They were the authorities, the people you have to go to, if you are autistic and need help and information. I didn't know any other autistic people, in 1996 and 1997. It would be many years before I got online and found I wasn't the only one who thought what happened was horribly wrong.

This set begins with "Miles Davis and Horns" and "Dig" from the early 50's. Much of this music is not exceptional, being rather run of the mill jazz. But these two albums do contain some compositions which begin to show how good the early Davis bands (and Davis) were. The overall sound and feel is of a musician looking for his own individual sound. The next album, "Collectors' Items" is a bit better with musicians like Sonny Rollins, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones playing on some of Davis' better early tracks. With "Blue Haze", "Walkin'", "Bags' Groove", and "The Modern Jazz Giants", Davis is starting to form his own sound and approach to jazz. This is perhaps the first time Davis sounds like the jazz giant he was to become-and is some of his best early playing.
Took the Lincoln for a quick spin and pulled into a parking lot to check the idle speed, I was approached by a guy who wanted to know all about the car. Turns out he was a big Ford fan.

But wait a minute! What about as shit? It has complications of its own. I said above that it has been completely grammaticalized into an intensifier, but I lied. It still has some of its original meaning–not in the shit part, but in the part that compares some property of the modified noun with that of shit. Sure, to be dumb as shit means to be really dumb, but if we’re talking even dumber than that, we don’t just say *dumber as shit; it has to be dumber than shit.

At first, I was a bit disappointed that Bialik didn’t get into more of the how-tos of gentle discipline or other more formal tenets of AP. However, as the hour-and-a-half progressed, I became grateful for the direction that the talk took. It was interesting to learn the reasons behind what motivated Bialik to write her story for those interested in learning more about AP, and it was lovely to listen to someone talk about the topic in just about the least judgmental and non-threatening way possible for such a potentially divisive subject. She not only told personal anecdotes to support her personal reasons for subscribing to the AP lifestyle, but she being a neuroscientist also gave many evidential accounts of why an AP-based parenting path can grow the best human brains possible (her dissertation at UCLA was a neuroscientific investigation of Prader-Willi syndrome).

If anything the growing divisions with Belarus are an even greater blow to Russian esteem and pan-Slav ambitions. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the president of Russia’s western neighbour and the closest Europe now has to an old-style dictator, is proving to be particularly bloody-minded in his determination not to fall under the servitude of Moscow. There have been disputes over the price of gas. Lukashenka, moreover, is even more awkward over sensitive issues of Russian political prestige. He has refused to recognise the independence of South Ossetia or Abkhazia, the two breakaway Georgian territories that served as a cause for the 2008 war. He also gave refuge to Kurmanbek Bakiyev, the former president of Kyrgyzstan, a figure much despised in Moscow.

The slaughters then in Iraq and Afghanistan and now in Pakistan and Yemen, are remote to us. They come to us in thirty second bites on the evening news or as crawls at the bottom of the screen. We talk about bombings and air strikes and killing as casually as we discuss the weather, as if what is being done in our name is of no consequence to us, as if other life has no meaning. We weep for the baby in a well but close our eyes to the babies in hell.
These are the thoughts that enter his mind. Thoughts that wind up – realities of failure and calculations of the limited distance that he could run to.
The subtitle gives the story away, but given the funny cartoons it was curiosity of how it is narrated that make a reader like me pick the book and read.

Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? takes its title from the response Winterson’s adoptive mother made when she told her how happy she was in a relationship with another woman. Ah, Mrs Winterson, who has loomed large in the public perception of the author to the detriment of two and a half decades of interesting work. She only has herself to blame, perhaps, having begun her career with a semi-autobiographical novel, and having begun that novel with a depiction of her monstrous mother. (“Like most people, I lived for a long time with my mother and father. My father liked to watch the wrestling. My mother liked to wrestle. It didn’t matter what. She was in the white corner and that was that.”) For Oranges are not the only fruit to have become Winterson’s most famous book is not very surprising: it’s her most straightforward, her most plainly warm and witty and affecting. (The award-hogging TV adaptation didn’t hurt.) What came next in her fiction was always more ambitious, and to me more interesting, even when it felt inchoate or reiterative. Oranges is the book, twenty-six years old, which is still the only one namechecked on this cover; though that’s apt enough as it seems clear that this memoir is destined to become her second most famous.

What purpose do Awards serve? President Obama in receiving the Peace Prize was controversial because he did not fit the profile of what we think of when we think of Awards – past achievements, a proven role model for success in the field and beacon to others to highlight past unsung work. For their abilities. Obama fits none of these in the field of peace – yet. He has not proven any abilities yet.

We look forward to sharing many great wedding-inspired ideas with you this month.
She scurried over to it, squatted down on the floor, and just stared at it, probably thinking something along the lines of, "Where have you BEEN all my LIFE! I freaking LOVE you!" Then she promptly popped that sucker in her mouth and carried on as usual.
Why should I expect fairness at this point? I don't understand it, but there is this instinctive reaction to revert to deservedness and worth and none of it matters. Even if there was some sort of cosmic meritocracy, what makes anyone more or less deserving of tragedy? I could say why me, why me, why me - but as others have pointed out - why not me? Why not these people? Or why anyone?
But I wasn't ready. I needed time to understand the city, to get the flow of life here, to know others who rode their bicycles around. Even then, I just wasn't prepared to make the plunge. Why was I being so cautious? I wondered where I could I keep it. I asked my gardienne if I, too, would be allowed to park a bike in the courtyard, where there are already four in permanent residence. "Mais bien sur," she replied, "comme tous les autres locataires." Of course I had the same rights as the other tenants. Why was I being so anxious? Despite my happy-go-lucky exterior, I clearly am not as adventurous as I might appear.
Some of you may know I reside in South Africa, which recently celebrated (27 April) Freedom Day.� Freedom day celebrates freedom and commemorates the first post-apartheid elections which happened on the same day in 1994.� It was definitely a victory for the time, and the more I thought about it, the more questions popped up.� On my freedom day, and up until now, I been doing quite a bit of reading, watching documentaries and brushing up on some things I didn’t know.� Some of the stuff I came across I knew already, some I didn’t, but it did put a lot of�it into perspective.� Yes, perhaps it is a bit depressing reading about the inequalities of the world and how it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible to do anything about it.
She packed many things. Her personal belonging that she would wish to bring with her all fit into a single large chest, including her day wear of robes, her training outfit, her battle armor, her ceremonial armor. That was sure to impress the children; it glinted with platinum and purple metal, fitted together with the finest of linens dyed white and purple. It had always held a special place in her heart, reminding her of the time it was first granted to her, an heirloom passed down from her grandmother she never met, Bru’sha, a great paladin in her own right. She was surprised it had made it through the crash with little to repair, along with many other goods that had been stored on the Exodar in one giant holding room.

Editor’s Note: Jim Webb and Michael Mooney knew each in the old neighborhood back in Philadelphia. Many, many, maybe too many? ... no, it’s all about the journey, right? Okay. Years later, events fell from the stars in such a way that Jim found himself living in Santa Fe and Michael living in Taos. Both, truly die hard music fans, write in an almost esoteric, conscious streaming that is reminiscent of fine jazz (Michael) and blues (Jim). Stay tuned and enjoy.

I have become a bargain shopper over the years. My $300 coats have been replaced by reinvented vintage items that I have found at thrift shops for $3-6. Sometimes I have to add a button or a new lining, but the items wear better than their over-priced brethren. I believe it is the pride of accomplishment stitched into it. So, instead of heading to the Anthro store, I’m going to dive thru thrift shops and dollar stores to find mugs to bring back to life.
Great name, huh? I really like it.
Our discussion Tuesday was on the Heart Chakra, the point of entry to our true spirit! The heart chakra is located in the upper center of the chest and it is in this area we often feel lightness, openness, fullness when we are happy, when we are feeling love and feeling loved.
The dark, angst ridden stuff I wrote, back then, oh god, should I be embarrassed…..tonight is my last night in my current house, and so, all the old odds and ends and hidden boxes of souvenirs were finally pulled out from under the bed. And there it was, ‘the memories box’ – all dusty and ragged looking but still able to cast a silent spell of nostalgia over me. I hunched up to the wall and lifted the lid. Ryder Cup passes, Electric Picnic passes (the less sunny Irish attempt at Coachella) and other random cinema tickets, birthday cards and letters to loved ones when I lived in France. And then, there they were – letters and late night poetry to ‘The Boy’.
Jane Campion’s The Piano is one of my favorite movies of all time. I regretted not having reviewed this for the LAMBs in the Director’s Chair with her and Kathryn Bigelow a couple of months ago. The movie won Oscars for Best Actress, Supporting Actress and Original Screenplay. Watching the film again made me marvel at the subtle poetry displayed onscreen.
I've been really busy for the last few weeks with pretty much every aspect of my life. There's been a lot of work, and stress, and change; and yesterday, in the midst of a move, I decided to take some time to unwind while doing something I love: cooking with beer! What follows is the best recipe I've come up with for Carbonnades Flamandes yet. What makes this one really stand out is that I smoked the meat prior to continuing with the rest of the recipe. It gives it a great red color, and adds a ton of flavor that melds well with the rest of the dish.

Leaving any shot of Manny out of this sequence for nearly a minute, this is a much tighter reframing of the previous shot, focusing on the third woman. The heads of the other two women trying to work their way into the frame, almost burdening the third woman before she even works up the nerve to look in Manny's direction, brings out the tension in this scene.

For those of you fortunate to have waited out the 6+ months to see all of Bakemonogatari, and enjoyed it, then Nisemonogatari is right up there with it. There is no real story or plot to reiterate here, it stars Koyomi Araragi (Kamiya Hiroshi) as an average high school senior who got tangled up in some supernatural events from an old friend and became a vampire for a short time. He was restored, but retained some vampire-like elements, such as heightened awareness and regeneration. He meets Hitagi Senjougahara (Saito Chiwa) and helps her to rid her of a similar ailment that had been plaguing her. The two would adventure through their daily lives interacting more supernatural phenomenon and eventually become a relationship together. In the sequel, The black swindler Kaiki Deishu, comes back to make trouble, and Koyomi’s sisters, Karen and Tsukihi (Kitamura Eri and Iguchi Yuka) take up the charge to bring it down.

When I lived in New York City, between the Jones Beach murder and the riots in Crown Heights in Brooklyn— the neighborhood I lived in— I knew that racism was something the north needed to work on as well. I’ve heard racial slurs come out of the mouths of New Yorkers that I never heard come out of my racist grandmother in Georgia. And it continues. Last November, in White Plains, N.Y., 68-year-old African American and former Marine Kenneth Chamberlain was Tasered and shot to death in his own home by police when his medical alert pendant went off. It was a false alarm and the pendant recorded the entire event, including Chamberlain pleading for his life with police.
And later that day, we went to see the 270 year-old Tybee Island Lighthouse.

“AMC’s original hit series Mad Men has become quite the talk around many marketing firms” (Votral). And, this is just one of the many ways the culture of Mad Men is still extremely relevant today. Despite it being set half a century ago, the problems encountered by the characters of Mad Men precisely parallel those which we encounter today. Office romantic affairs, husband and wife betrayal, conflicting advertising agencies, self centered human beings, hiding homosexuality, you name it. These are all major plot problems in the series, and all of them are relevant problems to the lives of contemporary people, as well. It might appear to be extreme; we may frown upon these people immensely, but we are no different. We know this. That is why we love the show. It’s simple, really.

With four kids in school, I don't make a habit of going through their backpacks every night. Obviously. They pull out their homework and any papers for me, I help them with their homework if they need it, I check it, I sign their homework journal, and they put everything back into the bag. I guess, from now on, I'll have to ask, "Do you have any homework? Do you have any papers for me? Do you have anything that needs to be signed? Do you have any cartons of chocolate milk in your backpack?"
And usually it does. But then, unluckily, one day it doesn’t. And the consequences are terrible. On the other hand, if it hadn’t been for that coin, Jack and Jess would never have met.

I think it's a perfectly valid argument for a craft beer fan to say, "Yeah, but we don't want them to grow! We want them to stay small and crafty." It's your opinion - beers are built by fans and fans have a say, and God knows, I'm all for supporting small companies because they are not multinationals. But remember, when a big company buys a small company in this way, the small company also wants to sell. If the people who built this thing from scratch, who devoted 20 years of their lives to it, decide this is the next step in the evolution of the business, you have to respect that.
With that, I woke her father and we began mapping out a plan for her. We are fortunate to have dear friends in New Zealand who I knew would be there for her. It gives me great comfort to think of them. This is the most difficult part of being an expat. Different countries, different homes, friends and family spread out across continents. It is like orchestrating a large chess board. A strategy goes in to place but in the end we have to have faith that whatever the move, it is the right one. We started making phone calls and within a short time she had a place to stay if and when she could get to Auckland.
I suppose that's the answer.

To be an artist, you have to learn a craft, start to create, and add your imagination. And the only way to get success and to hold it, is to keep in touch with your imagination, keep getting inspired. Many successful artists get blocked in their imagination and inspiration. Very wisely, Dutch TV-presenter Mies Bouwman gave this advise to tv/musical tycoon Joop van den Ende: “Nothing is more lethal than compliments and applause all the time.”
So. Good, bad, interesting. That's the booze policy news this week.
Let’s hope some day they will be responsible. Although I doubt it, because history shows otherwise. For example back in 1976 events (Thongchai Winichakul was one of the students’ leaders then) when many protesters have been slaughtered by para-military ultra-right thugs, the whole thing has also started because some Thai MSM newspapers has published some doctored photos, thus causing a very strong reaction from already too radical conservatives. Were they EVER held responsible? well, the most they did was – Bangkok Post has “apologized” for that case, and even that was done mostly because rival newspaper has raised this issue mostly for reasons to decrease their ratings as a competitors. THAT’S ALL ! Thus I doubt it very much that anyone of Thai “reporters” would ever be held accountable.

Back to Back have never had any truck with "special" treatment: their work has a harsh honesty that makes it impossible to patronise. But they also specialise in moments of breath-taking beauty that assert the sheer power of their skills. There are images I won't forget: the impossible poignancy and strangeness, for example, of Ganesh, dressed in a business suit, standing before Hitler, who is played by Simon in a ridiculous knitted Hitler costume. Or an evocation of Indra's net, when a back curtain of stars was lifted to reveal a blazing light, like a sunrise. I've never seen anything like this show, because only Back to Back could make it. They are, simply, our most important independent theatre company.

When our life isn’t working out the way we want it to, we often blame external things or other people. The relationship isn’t working because he is dysfunctional, your job isn’t recognizing your full potential, or you aren’t making enough money and can’t afford a vacation. And it’s because of this or because of that, this circumstance or that person. Although these may manifest as external problems, it is often emotions or thought patterns that hold us back.

Vitiligo is a common skin disorder in which white spots appear on the skin usually occurring on both sides of the body in the same location. Vitiligo occurs in 1-2% of the population. The melanocytes are the cells that make the skin color. In people with vitiligo, the immune cells (cells which fight infection) attack the melanocytes and kill them. When the melanocytes in a certain area die the skin turns white. No one knows why the immune cells attack the melanocytes in people with vitiligo.

But the real oddity of this irregular Wednesday was its connection to our adoption. Wednesday, December 14, 2011, was the day Vickie and I would first meet our African boys. How does one meet his child for the first time? On prior first meetings of our children, we knew the arrangements were outside our control. When it is time for labor, it’s time! When labor is complete, it is complete. When the baby is delivered–well, that’s when you get to meet him. With adoption, it is different. Plane tickets are purchased in advance to reach Africa. You know well ahead of time when and where you will meet your child.

Government payrolls are generally not hit immediately when recession strikes, but several months or years afterward, when state and local governments are dealing with lower tax revenues from the suffering private sector. There's therefore a lag between private-sector and public-sector layoffs.
Out of the 4 shades, I was most drawn to Exquis. It's a beautiful and complex shade that's very fitting for Fall. Merveille is a little too bright for me, which I think is more fitting for Summer or Spring. Apparat is also another gorgeous Fall/Winter shade that can easily be worn for a wedding or Christmas party. I think Or Divin will be very soft and flattering for lighter skin ladies. For me, it brings out too much of the yellow in my skin tone. I also found this shade to be streakier and more difficult to work with compared to the other 3. In fact, it also took the longest to dry.

For the budding novelist hungry for fame and fortune, I am probably not a very good role model. Forgive me not providing a magic bullet for recognition and mass readership. And who knows?

Sometimes it seems like whisky quality is inversely proportional to the hype surrounding it. I can no longer count the amount of times I've been let down by highly touted special releases. On the other hand, obscure indy bottlings or even budget daily pours are sometimes unpublicized gems. During the holiday season, the whisky hype can get totally out of the control, which is why it is especially refreshing to find some bottles that meet if not exceed the hype.

Chemical exfoliation will loosen the stickiness of the raisin layer allowing it to better release. Lactic acid, retinols, salicylic acid and poly hydroxy acids are all great choices. The power is in the combination of the physical and chemical working together. For best results, look for regimens that provide a synergistic approach that incorporates these ingredients into its steps.

Foundation is everything. Here is where many folks don't even realize just what it is the horse needs for a complete foundation. I have never known a horse that Tom has trained give it's owner a dangerous time. I have seen him work at things that no ordinary person or trainer would think of doing with a horse. What is added (in the way of another layer) will give the horse a sense of security, a sense of purpose, a sense that he can satisfy the human, a developed habit to willingly obey, a complete job description (if you will) in how to act around humans. The horse is taught how to reply to discipline. The horse is given a "peace zone" where they have a reference place to go when things become scary or overwhelming for them. If things go really bad, the horse knows to override the instinct to run and stands instead. I like that layer! I have been in a place where I made a bad decision and instead of my horse blowing up to run and get us both hurt, he simply stayed in place until I could extricate us from my driver error that caused a turnover. Many layers are added with a "soaking in" period in between. There is no recipe he follows...it is the individual horse that determines how to proceed and what is needed and taught.

We're well past the equinox and the sun makes itself known around 3.30am, setting some time after 10 at night. There aren't many clouds up this way at the moment and the snow is starting to melt. Most of the ice is already gone, but months of snowfall takes longer to thaw. It turns into a blanket of brittle glittering crystals before it finds its way back into being water. Where days ago I could walk on the surface, I now fall through to my knees. Sheets of snow which have been hanging like awnings over the edge of houses fall away. Massive clumps come sliding down off the roof and thump on the wooden boards of the house's veranda, where I sit writing this, wearing a jacket, a hat and fingerless gloves.
It bothered me a little how many “Twilight-isms” were found in this book. It has a love triangle between Laurel, the beautiful faerie girl, David, her friend from school, and Tam the mysterious faerie sentry. (Though I have to say that I find Laurel to be a much more agreeable main character than Bella.) I also found the love of the two boys a lot less creepy then in Twilight. They weren’t creepily following her around and insisting that she could only be happy with them. They both just want her to be happy. (Cliché I know)
After the cleaning finally stopped, my mom, sister, and I headed to the local mall for a bit of shopping. I got a really cute little black dress for an amazing price!

*Our church...we love. But with Ross as an elder, things can get a little overwhelming sometimes. People are messy and broken and have all kinds of problems. It's our calling and life's work to walk with people through all that. But thankfully our church also recognizes that the leaders need rest and give accordingly. So many pastors burn out and even walk away from the Lord because it can just get to be too much. Praise the Lord that our church protects and cares for the leaders enough to give them a paid sabbatical!

You already know I can't talk about the animals without mentioning Stella, the Mustang Princess, ever watchful, giving us the love whinny whenever our kitchen door creaks on its hinges, day or night. She and I are at that stage now, the one I've patiently waited to arrive. That stage would be the one Pangolin suggested we go for when the moment was right. We put our heads together trading breaths. Thanks Pangolin. A beautiful and holy experience for which there are no words in our language to describe. A final word on the holiday, perhaps one of the loveliest, indoors, ceiling fans blowing off the outside world of chemtrails and Big Ag's smog snaking through the passes, the dogs were served vanilla ice cream and ice cubes in the water bowl.

Here’s the truth of it. Sin is not sinful because it makes God sad or angry. We’re so egotistical to think that looking too long at the cover of Cosmo can emotionally unbalance God. Sin is sinful because it separates us from others and takes us out of the mindset to commune with God. We fail to realize that we are surrounded…in ever molecule of existence…by God. We act like praying really hard will get him to “come down,” but we ignore the fact that if we weren’t so obsessed with our own failures, we’d be able to reach out and experience the essence of God all around us.

I had never had cherries jubilee before so I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like; it ended up tasting like caramelized cherries, but not with an overwhelming cherry taste. So I pureed the sauce, and then mixed a portion of it with cream cheese, to give the filling a bit more tartness. Then I made a batch of whipped cream, which I then folded into the cherry cream cheese mixture.
This is REALLY how I view the Super Bowl every year. I don't hate football, but I do love eating ridiculous foods that I only feel justified in making a few times a year, as well as watching funny commercials. I am more than willing to put up with the football part of the event to reap the joy of these two SUPER bonuses.

Eloise smiled, it's alright dear. I'll miss you most of all. You were always my favorite, although you stopped calling. I realise I'd stopped living 20 years ago, and I wasn't that fun to be around. 'Petra put a hand on her aunts and smiled wickedly. When you started drinking wine out of cardboard boxes, and put up those hideously orange curtains, I had to say stop. There would be no recovering from that, Eloise.
WALKER: Part of that is because the distribution force has been aging quite steadily and relatively few of the producers have succession plans. There’s a real question of where distribution is going to come from. It’s been a very challenging decade and the trends don’t look that good. Independent agents had been steadily building share at the expense of the captives. But that trend reversed itself over the past four years, and now the captives are outgrowing independents at a fairly substantial rate. A large factor is the big mutuals, which are doing very well and recruiting at a fairly rapid rate. If you think about the companies that were hurt the most during the meltdown—AIG, ING, Sun Life, etc.—they are heavily skewed toward third-party distribution. So, the big mutuals are building their agency force rapidly, while a lot of the third-party product providers are cutting back their product portfolio because they’ve been hurt on the balance sheet side.

Still, physical fitness for the non-professional was largely the province of people with enough money to have leisure time. Subsistence farmers and day laborers didn’t have the luxury of pursuing “rock-hard abs” and “buns of steel.” And so, the Austin Athletic Club was initially open only to private subscribers, though it was later sold to the City in 1931, to serve at Austin’s first community recreation center.

By sheer coincidence one of the beams of light hit an opaque glass dome set into one of the rings. It bounced off the ceiling and the crystal making a geometric shape. From below Se’rith indicated to Brelnya to line up the remaining two glass domes with the other two beams of light. It was clear that the Dwemer had some very specific intention for this device. Paratus could hardly contain his glee as the Dunmer manipulated the remaining rings until all the beams of light were reflecting and refracting off the glass domes.
The merchants filled their ship with new merchandise and set sail for distant lands and, passing the island again, were welcomed by Tsaritsa Marfa and Tsarevitch Guidon, to whom they recounted their visit to Tsar Saltan. Nor did they fail to tell how he had purposed to sail thither until he had heard of the fir tree, the squirrel and the nuts of gold and emerald.
The responses, again from Hari Kumar, appear to be variations on a pro forma email. Kumar begins by managing expectations: ‘As you know, there are no guarantees in the publishing industry and we cannot guarantee that an agent would consider taking you on, even after a referral from Brit Writers.’ After a boost of praise for the work (‘This is a captivating, stylishly written book and is timely as it addresses current issues’) Kumar identifies problems with the synopsis, pitch or formatting that mean that ‘the assessors could not refer your work to agents immediately.’

Meanwhile, new Silesians arrived, the people from the new Russian territories who were given the choice between becoming Russian or moving - or no choice at all. Traumatised and homesick, though these people were, glad to find themselves moving into the often comfortable homes the Germans had been expelled from - right down to furniture, crockery, and bottled fruit and jam- many of them never really settled down in Silesia, always afraid that the Germans would return and they would be be driven out again. The next generation, happily, is more settled.
It is difficult for me to believe that Mitt will be the rights puppet as first and foremost he is representing the Mormon Church. It is history that tells us that once Grover Norquist seals the deal by guaranteeing the votes, then his candidate of choice has no ability to go back on the deal made. With Mitt’s soul already spoken for by the Mormon Church the negotiations will take time as we have seen already with the delay of the Santorum endorsement. Anyone who believes it is just because they don’t like each other after a dirty primary run, is either naive or misleading themselves or the American public. Mitt, personally, does lean more moderate, but he is being reinvented as I write this. We will know if and when he does agree to the pressure of ,Grover Norquist, as when he does he will gain the full support and endorsement of Rick Santorum and his constituency.

Shortly thereafter, Amanda, feeling better than I, slowly pulled away from me. We had determined earlier that if one of us were feeling good, that girl should go. This was her moment. I was glad one of us was feeling okay! Me, all I wanted to do was unswallow everything I had already swallowed for the day. It was that feeling when you know that if you do that, you will surely feel better. Several miles later, I even stopped by a large trash can, in hopes that I would be productive. But I got all crowd shy, and nothing happened. On I went. But then, I started realizing how lightheaded I was. At each aid station, I was not walking straight. Zig-zagging along. I’d pour water on my arms, down my neck, over my head. Anything to cool me down.

There’s this band called Frou Frou that has a song called Let Go that is featured in a really sad scene in the movie Garden State, which Zach Braff stars in (and I totally have a flashbulb memory of the moment I saw that scene but I will spare you all). In the song, there’s one lyric that has always moved me more than the rest, “there’s beauty in the breakdown.” I really believe that’s true on so many levels. Breakdowns are so necessary. They keep us sane, they keep us balanced, they let us be totally and completely honest. They aren’t a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength.
With guidance and encouragement from Mr. Biggs and even a little coaching from the legendary Frank Guida, Jones decided to start his own label. In 1975, Ray used his connection with bassist Maurice Glass to enlist the mighty 35th Street Gang (AKA: Raw Soul) to back him on a recording date at Lenis Guess Studio. The first single from the self-produced session, "That Norfolk Sound" was paired with his earlier recording of "Cause You're Coming Home" and released on the newly launched Wee-Too. Ray decided to use his family's Philadelphia address on the label.

Every house tells a story. Who lived here before you? What did they do? How did they live? Was there more happiness and laughter than sorrow and pain? Were children born here? Did anyone die here?

I learnt something whilst making these; cranberries have a lot of sugar, even more than sultana’s. Having them in biscuits such as these is all good and doesn’t worry me. But whilst I was cooking Miss F was eating these by the handful as I thought they would be fine. But 30mins later I had an absolute nightmare on my hands. Miss F changes to a completely different person if she eats too much sugar; she’s a real little terror. So lesson learned there!

Sometimes the best way to help another and protect yourself is to just “…Walk away from them, sending them blessings and prayers on your way out.” Pg 118

After annoying Wendy and Shelby with snippets of pre- I Am The Man Anthrax, pre- South Of Heaven Slayer, and a little taste of Peace Sells from Megadeth, I decided to compile a list of albums (yes kids, albums- ask your parents what that means) I absolutely wore out as a 14-16 year old. The albums I listened to while locked away in my room with headphones on. The ones that created a bit of hearing damage. Albums which defined my disturbed adolescence and provided me with some fuel to get through some pretty rough patches.

I am not a skilled baker. Worse, I’m a bachelor. Unsupervised, better equipped at reheating leftovers than creating something as fragile and sophisticated as a tart, I failed to replicate the flavors of the butter tarts I’d read about in the Toronto Star’s article “The art of the tart.” The recipe I used was from a group of sixth-graders. It won first place in a contest. The paper described it as having “a full-flavoured, buttery filling that is neither firm nor runny, in pie bald plain and chocolate pastry shells that are difficult to reproduce.” It’ll say.

In the next section, I was with a friend, again going to a lake. I said, “What is the name of this lake?” As we came within view of it and I noted that it was a nearly opaque brown color, I remarked, “Oh, yes, I remember: Mud Lake.” Instead of floating on it in a boat, we were floating and traveling on it in a big yellow school bus, with my friend doing the driving. At one point, the bus–having taken a turn too quickly, I think–began to tip over onto its right side into the muddy water. I felt a split-second of panic until I noted that most of the bus’s windows were open on the left side, and that it would be fairly easy to just climb out as the bus began to sink. I was in the back of the bus, and at the moment I concocted that escape plan, I looked across the length of the bus and saw that my eldest son was at the other end, near the driver’s seat. As he looked at me, I said, “Are you okay?” But I meant it more like, “You understand what we need to do? Are you ready to do it?” Just as I was about to climb out the window, the bus righted itself and I awoke shortly afterward.

There were numerous hand tools and a riding lawn mower like Xu Guan had seen used on the large lawns at the military bases where he had been stationed.

Now, this is a strange situation: when a metal band breaks away from the mothership they usually try to get a different target audience. It's a very risky endeavor and it usually ends in failure, but the few bands that achieve that keep everything but the name, effectively. They change their whole aesthetic to suit the demands of their new followers. 'Atmospheric metal' bands that go off in non-metal territories however are naive in a special way: they keep their surface aesthetic signifiers but they just do away with the heavy guitars and growly vocals. They are trying to become indie, electronic or gothic rock outfits while they're still earnest - though moribund - metalheads at heart. They didn't get the memo you can't play metal without the metal and expect it to still work.

The apartment building was another upscale one, under lock and key. We got buzzed in and entered the compound. It is one of those places that strives to be modern in its appearance. I don’t like it. It tried to hard to be modern and in the atempt it looked tacky and had a cold, impersonal feeling. Large walls baracaded the residents into a secluded world of unnecessary beams, odd architecure that did not serve any purpose and lonely, impersonal doors that led to the apartment/compartments that housed people’s esxistence. No one has yards, everyone is boxed into their secluded place and your entire life may go unkown to an outsider until someone comes by to collect your junk. I don’t like the place.

Now you might be asking why I would want to do such a thing. The main reason has nothing to do with the fact I am a mad collector of all things Pooh…though I am. It has much more to do with the fact that I caught myself singing that as I was getting ready for bed that last two nights. My first thought was, “Hm, I’m hungry. Maybe I should eat something so that my rumbly tumbly doesn’t keep me awake all night…” I was half way to the kitchen when I shook myself out of auto-pilot and stopped dead in my tracks.

How cool would it be to see THIS kind of facility take shape when BYU finally tears out it's 60 year old pool facility?! Then the annual State High School Swim championships would REALLY be held in high style. Then Utah county would have a facility equal to that of Davis County's beautiful aquatic center in the Bountiful Recreation center. Then, maybe our city officials could see the advantage of building better than they think we need for our city--and our kids--and our high school.

9. Crocs
Pies are big in the south whether it be the classic double or single crusted pie, cobbler, or fruit crisp. A fruit crisp is a like a pie, but much easier. When time is an issue this is my "go to" dessert. No pie dough to make, instead a quick mixture of butter, flour, sugar and spices is combined and sprinkled over the fruit. I also add oats and nuts which are optional but I never leave them out. I think the oats and nuts make the crisp topping by giving more depth of flavor and the all important crunch. Usually it bakes during dinner, so after dinner a delicious, warm fruit crisp awaits. Break out the essential vanilla ice cream and enjoy.

Free Write. By far one of the easiest ways to get those creative juices flowing is to just start writing. Anything. It doesn't matter what it's about. Just grab a piece of paper and start writing whatever comes to your mind—don't over think, don't edit and most importantly don't stop. Just write. Sure, your finished project will probably be filled with a bunch of unusable junk, but you might just end up with a gem—or at least a few note worthy lines.

Brookmyre said that he started writing at the age of 6, and most of his early stuff was a straight rip-off of what he was reading (he spent two months writing nothing but stories about sharks eating people after seeing Jaws). He had a great teacher at school and, when he wrote two versions of the same story in class (one cleaned up and one with swearing and necrophilia) she told him it was the best thing he had ever written. She supported him in writing it and gave it to the headmaster. Unfortunately, she did not choose her words carefully enough when she said to the headmaster "I think you really ought to see this."

Tebbit is like all the rest. He ignored the public's voice while in a position of power. Then once away from his position, he waits (how many years out of office?) until other politicians say it's time to talk about immigration, and then he stands up to be counted.
Romney will bow out in a respectable loss but a loss is a loss is a loss. Romney is a weak candidate that doesn’t have much upside potential but all the traits necessary for Obama to win. I didn’t even mention Romneycare. Oops, I just did.
You see, when I do slow down and look for God, I grab onto a set of "legs" I think are His. It's only after while do I actually look and realize I haven't been following who I should be. During these times I feel lost, lonely, broken and defeated. When I am walking with the Father, I feel loved, secure, peaceful and hopeful.

Our son has social challenges, he is unaware of the appropriate way to interact with others. He does not have the skills necessary to hold conversations with others, or even to play at a playground. He becomes so hyper-focused on what he’s doing that he loses track of anything going on around him. So if he’s at the playground and there are small children around, he becomes an immediate danger, because he doesn’t pay attention to them in relation to himself. He’s so big (at almost 6 feet) that it intimidates other parents, they fear for their children. Several have considered him a “predator”… why else would a 16 year old be completely content to play on a little kids playground? Well, because he’s autistic… because he’s 10 years developmentally delayed – and even though he looks 16 he’s really only 6 inside that big old body of his…
Now, he’s baaack!
I’m quite enamoured with the whole indie self-publish thing, so I can only see the pros. I always knew I had a story that didn’t fit in the parameters being purchased by traditional publishers. To be honest, I never really tried to force my story to fit that market. When I wrote it, I had no idea that there would be an explosion in e-books or a renaissance for under-used story settings and time periods.
I will be moving into my new apartment on SATURDAY!!!!! My dad is coming up here to help me move in, and I’m really excited since I haven’t seen him since Spring Break. I’ll be getting a mattress, table and chairs, futon couch, and some smaller items like dishes, cleaning supplies, cooking supplies, and bedding. I’ll be getting my bed frame from PBteen once I get back from home – I have to get all my clothes and some smaller items out of my room and Zach’s. I’m also hoping to get some subscriptions sent to my new apartment! I would like to get Science, Nature, The New Yorker, The New York Times, Journal of Maritime Archaeology, and The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. I may also renew my Nat Geo subscription, but I’m not completely sure yet.

The other, and more serious reason to love Josh Hutcherson this week came when he was honored at the GLAAD Awards. When researching Josh for my initial post on him, I came to learn about his work with “Straight but Not Narrow”. A group dedicated to dispelling misconceptions about gay people to high school aged students. During the media’s inescapable coverage of “the Hunger Games” cast it was revealed Josh had lost two gay relatives to AIDS and was inspired by them to be active in the movement for LGTB equality. It was due to his work towards that goal and his involvement in SBNN that earned him the GLAAD Vanguard award. At first, I was nervous that the Vangaurd award might be a little premature. But, those feelings were dispelled after seeing Josh’s emotional, intelligent and heart string tugging acceptance speech. Calling for equality not just in marriage but in all aspects and even going as far as to discuss his hopes for his own children should they be gay, Josh pretty much made it impossible to not love him.

I love students to work together in math! Having students teach their neighbor and work together on a problem is so rewarding for me and for the students. I usually incorporate this in every lesson. The students always have a worksheet that is front and back. The front side we do together and the backside is independent work. I mix up how they work together often though. One day they will complete the front of the sheet as a group, the next day they complete the front alone then share with their neighbor what they got.

Old man Clooney was the only man on the Creek, who knew how to make moonshine that wouldn’t kill whoever took a drink. Living his life on top of Patch Mountain gave him a sense of unwarranted superiority. He was the type of man who could hit a deer with a small riffle from two hundred and fifty yards away. Yet, he couldn’t hit the huge hole which marked the outhouse facilities. Clooney was a loner and didn’t spend anytime socializing. A simple creature, he could survive his entire life with only three things: beer, boxer shorts and batteries for the remote control of his 1979 Zenith television. Other than those who visited Clooney via Dragnet, his favorite show, was when people came looking for hillbilly spirits. People came by hoping to open a fresh bottle of corn squeezin’s, which Clooney made often. Moonshine, an alcoholic beverage that when made and sold without permits and taxes paid is illegal. The alcohol is usually clear was water and runs to about 180 poof.

Finally, while there is no record of a response by government forces to Renwick’s preaching at Woolf-hole-craig’, they did respond to the Cairnhill preaching. In July 1684, the authorities do not appear to have captured have any prisoners from the Cairnhill or Cauldstane Slap preachings and did not know which minister or ministers had preached at them. It is possible that the government response produced further information on location of the preachings and the identify of the preacher. That may explain why the proclamation of 20 September recorded that Renwick was the preacher at the Woolf-hole-craig conventicle.
IT MAY BE an unusual career move, but becoming a shariah scholar for an Islamic bank is nice work if you can get it. A quick poll of bankers, lawyers and academics working in Islamic finance revealed unanimous agreement that shariah scholars — who approve every new Islamic banking transaction to certify its compliance to Islamic shariah law — are paid ‘a lot’, but few volunteered figures. Welcome to the opaque world of Islamic finance, and the fledgling industry’s ‘scholar problem’.

Long ago on that indoor range, over the hours, we practiced what's called the 'Harries method'. This involves holding the flashlight in the off-hand, across the shooters body, and resting the pistol to the left of the flashlight (for right handed shooters), with the wrist of the hand gripping the pistol laying on top of the other wrist. In the olden days, when all flashlights had their switch on the body in the traditional place, the Harries method called for an uncomfortable positioning of the off hand upside down, so the thumb could activate the switch. While difficult to describe, a few images will make the method clear. Here is the Harries method, adapted to a rear switched flashlight:

For instance, I had a dream that someone I know (a male) was mad at me and punched the hood of my car! I woke up scared and through research, I found out it was about a frustration I was having with a specific task at work. There were a few specific items in the dream that were significant. The car was red (passion), the car was on my right side (present day vs the past), the car was parked (stuck feeling), denting the car (my frustration at feeling stuck).

The following article provides more insights into this argument from a layman’s perspective.
See, I have a friend - we'll call her Spamtastic Sorryass - who saw a really nice desk and file cabinet that her friend's late father had owned, and thought "Wow, that would be great in my home!" So when she learned it would be part of the estate sale, she said "Oh, I definitely want that!" And she even wrote out a check for it. But then she realized that she didn't NEED the desk, she just WANTED the desk. She needed a bunch of other things instead. And she didn't even really have room for the desk. So she felt totally foolish. And she quickly called the estate sales person and asked that the desk be put back into the sale. And then she prayed that someone else would buy the desk. And now she is awake at half past midnight, freaking out that her friend will think she is a total spaz because she kept saying how much she wanted the desk previously.
In Mallorca, the natives would give names to people based on their appearance and demeanor like the Native Americans did. Margaret was aptly named “Little Horse” because she was always galloping up and down the streets in her boots, tall and strong and elegant.
The most fallacious argument in the sustainability quiver is the idea that doing things sustainably is cheaper. Doing things sustainably is only cheaper if the following conditions hold: 1. You are operating in a market that accurately and correctly assesses the costs of all externalities, 2. You are evaluating the cost model over a long time scale (i.e. decades or centuries, not quarters), and 3. You are willing to put a reasonable dollar value on the cost of ecological disturbance and/or destruction (OK, this is really part of number 1, but it needs emphasis). If your accounting does these three things, then ‘sustainable approaches’ are always more cost effective (note: this does not mean that any particular technology that claims to be sustainable is). If, however, your accounting system still operates on 3 month cycles and systematically disregards the externalities of its own processes (which is de jour in contemporary global business practice), then your accounting system will continue to tell you that sustainability is a bad investment, period (except for when it is really good marketing).

His family, according to the BBC, is divided about whether they believe him.

Roman Catholic lay author Gary Michuta provides numerous alleged examples from Athanasius, where Athanasius is allegedly quoting the apocrypha as scripture. One in particular is of interest:
See how, in general, the attenuation fell over time. As did the gravity. The FG, on the other hand, remained fairly constant. The beer in the recipe has a higher FG than the much stronger 1869 version. The hopping rate fell dramatically at the end of the 19th century, which must have had a big impact on the flavour of the beer.
It’s not just a Google project either. It seems like everyone has gotten aboard the augmented reality train. From comic books, to magazines, to hotels, to sports teams, to Nasa, almost everyone sees some application for augmented reality. Whether it’s enhancing your product (comics/magazines), selling ever more advertisements (ahem, Google), or helping pilots prevent plane crashes (NASA), most companies and organizations realize that augmented reality is the future. Perhaps, but do people actually want to augment their reality, and if they do, what does it mean to want to augment reality?
I am bemused by the position of the religious right on contraception. 99% of Catholic women use (or have used) birth control, but the Pope wants to beat on nuns for daring to counter the views of a bunch of old men. This also bleeds into the discussion around Planned Parenthood. Let me be plain on this. Young people are going to have sex and it will continue until they die. You can preach abstinence all you want, but it will not even make a dent. It is like trying to hold back a flood with sand bags. So, unless you want unplanned children and expose your children to STDs and AIDs, my advice is to promote as much knowledge about sex as possible. I would even suggest churches have balanced sex education classes. And, for those of you who say my child is not having sex, note that I live within three hours of well-known religious university. People who went there say the kids go wild there as they have been restrained for so long.

There have been times when she or I or another sister will pass on the street and pull the old “finger up the nose” gag to be funny. These types of things are just normal for us.

One project is a multi-media collaboration about internet safety and etiquette with students from Pakistan and the other project involves a cultural exchange/geography lesson using Google Maps with international students from a school in India. We still have some details to work out with all three projects, but when you have a group of enthusiastic teachers involved, most logistical problems seem easy to conquer.

J: To increase the awareness. There are still some people on the planet who don’t even know who Jesus is. They’ve never even heard the name. What we as Christians must do is tell them about who Jesus is and what he did for the human race. We cannot, and shouldn’t, try to or otherwise attempt to force our belief’s down somebody’s throat. We can tell them of their situation and of what they can do to become Christian and also relate how we became believers as well. But from there the decision to become a follower of Christ is their decision and theirs alone.

Watch Martyrdom and watch for irritability and crankiness in yourself and others as you face certain truths and realities. Don’t get stuck.

Especially watch self-judgment. Keep the mantra that “it is all good”.

I have heard of fine soldiers who have thought that the king of France, when he was defeated and captured by the emperor before Pavia, had all of his bad fortune because he had the pope’s, or as they boastfully call them, the Church’s, people with him. For after they came to his camp with a great cry of Ecclesia, ecclesia! “Church, Church!” there was no more good fortune there. This is what the soldiers say, though perhaps they do not know the reason for it, viz., that is not right for the pope, who wants to be a Christian, and the highest and best Christian preacher at that, to lead a church army, or army of Christians. For the Church ought not strive or fight with the sword; it has other enemies than flesh and blood, their name is the wicked devils in the air; therefore it has other weapons and swords and other wars, so that it has enough to do, and cannot mix in the wars of the emperor or princes, for the Scriptures say that there shall be no good fortune where men are disobedient to God.
And caught unawares – oh yea!
My giant steel 1950s office desk from downstairs can’t fit upstairs so I have to be satisfied with something smaller. My ideal desk is one the size of a dining room table, (which is another place I like to work) preferably one that wraps around me so I have a place for all of my research to be out and visible all at once. However, my smaller desk is not small enough. It measures 30 inches and my door is 29 and a quarter! Okay, so what else can I use? Fortunately for me, I have a habit of buying old tables, and one that converts into a bench is already upstairs being used as a bench. Put the top back on and voila, my new desk with space underneath for the cats to sleep.

When I met my ex-fiance, O, the relationship was already doomed to fail although I didn’t come to realise that until many years later. Throughout past relationships, my behaviour had developed into a seething cluster of resentment, mistrust and paranoia which ruined everything I came into contact with, and my tendency to fall for men who would take advantage of me had given me an incredibly skewed view on love. I believed equally in the great love story and the cruelty of men, hoping for the first but inevitably finding the other.

And the great thing about going to the park is that its free. There is always parks for kids to play at- wherever you are. My kids love going to the park and the one near my old workplace (by the sea) is always a favourite - especailly as the park has had a renovation and has now a pirate ship as part of the play area.

In comparing population sizes of each region to the average proportion of money these areas were receiving from the government fund, it becomes clear many are not being given representative help.
During the days leading up to Christmas, Ticos gather for posadas—neighbors meeting at each other’s homes to re-enact the travels of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem. During the posadas there is song, prayer, and food—especially tamales and rompope (eggnog—heavy on the rum)! Fat, juicy grapes and shiny apples load the shelves at our local grocery store. They are popular imported foods for the holidays and are a special treat at Christmas.

Somalis have long used charcoal in their homes for cooking. Charcoal is also one of the country’s biggest exports. To prepare charcoal, people chop down trees, stack the wood tightly, cover it with earth to limit the amount of available oxygen, and set it on fire. Without much oxygen, the wood does not burn completely. The partially burned pieces of wood are charcoal. In the past, woodcutters used axes to cut down trees. In modern times, woodcutters use chainsaws, and warlords largely control the business… As a result, acacia, mangrove, and other trees are rapidly disappearing.

I think you should alway take your phone with you. So many things could happen where you would need to call someone and have them come help you. All the “what ifs,” what if you fall, get bit by a dog, get lost, or get a cramp. The list is endless but in this day and age it’s just plain stupid to put yourself in a situation like that and not be able to get the help you need.

On the women's side we get a huge match up in the 100 meters with recently rejuvenated Olympic champion Shelly Ann Fraser (JAM) going up against the season's two hottest sprinters in the spring Kerron Stewart (JAM) and Carmelita Jeter (US). Jeter was undefeated this year until her loss to Fraser in Lausanne and will be looking to reverse things in Rome.
5. Divide pork mixture and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese among tortillas, placing meat and cheese near the edge of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas. Place filled tortillas, seam sides down, in the prepared baking dish (place tortillas close together); top with the remaining enchilada-green chile pepper mixture. Cover with foil; bake for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 5 minutes more or until heated through and cheese is softened and starts to brown slightly.

He eventually revealed his identity as Mariano Rivera, the ace reliever for the New York Yankees who is considered to be one of the best closers in baseball history. Mr. Rivera was cool with Ry’s inability to recognize his stardom, and even let Ry have his picture taken with him to show there were no hard feelings. Ry proudly displayed it as his profile picture on his facebook page.
The French mostly eat ducks. People think it’s is frogs legs and snails. Only tourists eat frogs legs and snails in France, the French laugh at you doing it. It’s a little known fact but I am confident that if the French were told they were no longer allowed to eat Ducks, or bits of Geese and Ducks, they would go into catatonic shock.

But what of the man and what of his writing? Admittedly I have not read as much of his work as I would have liked but so far, I have enjoyed what I have read. My first exposure was the short story Tis the Season, a near-future dystopian tale where Christmas has been privatised and license agreements are required and limits placed on the trinkets and traditions you might want to indulge in. Not so much a pop at commercialism as it is about intellectual rights and the absurdity of the politicisation of copyright law. Firmly tongue in cheek, it is an amusing parable for the times.
Me: Damn it.
The pad burned even worse than the liquor did. My friend Rachel offered to help me apply the medicines, which I happily accepted. She told me that her mom often gets achy muscles and favors the liquor medicine, so she (Rachel) is very practiced at using it to massage out pain. She did a number on me and I am ever so grateful! After she left, I took my aunt’s professional advice and gave myself a sequence of additional massages. I even attempted to stretch. Finally, I meditated for a bit and requested the help of the healing powers of the universe to help me recover ASAP. I texted my bosses to tell them I was taking the next day off from work, put my sleeping mask on, and slept for 12 hours straight. It was wonderful.
Unless you have been in a cave or if you still confuse The Hunger Games and Twilight, then you most definitely know the plot. The problem is that if you hear the plot you probably envision a film that is a lot more violent than it actually is. Just like the novel the film never leaves it’s pre-teen tone. Even the more violent parts feel sort of childish but that is what the book is and I’m sort of glad that is what the film is. That is the first thing that the film gets right and gets wrong. It is a faithful adaptation of the source material and only messes with certain elements on rare accounts. Yes there are characters omitted and subplots adverted but what did make the cut are the book’s most important parts. I do feel like the script should of never went behind the camera but it does add an extra element to the story. Even though it is a great thing that the film is so faithful, the movie still felt rushed. Events and characters feel pushed forward to try and fit in some of the filmmaker’s own additions. The script’s faithfulness creates a movie that is a great companion piece to the novel but never allows it to become a work of its own.

Brianna currently resides in Southern California. Brianna hopes to make a living off of her literary works and to connect with her readers. “Connections come from a common emotion that pulls on our heart strings.” Though satisfied with her life, Brianna writes dark material. ‘Flameless’ in ‘flamelessthoughts’ describes Brianna’s work. She has no reason to feel dark and depressed, but these stories and poems come to her. She feels she was put on this Earth to share these stories, and broken emotions to help people not feel so alone and desperate.

The village used to be known as simply “Crendon” but during the English Civil War, to avoid confusion with nearby Grendon that village had “Underwood” added, and Crendon gained a “Long” a remark on the ribbon development that is still in evidence today. In the 13th century Crendon and Aylesbury were the only two settlements in England where sewing needles were produced, also in the village is the excellent 15th century Manorial courthouse now under National Trust ownership and open to the public. More recently Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh had their marital home here.

With this first book Hands creates a breathtaking new angle on Angels and their purposes on earth. With such remarkable characters and beautiful attention to details the writing will captivate readers and transport them into the beauty of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. (As someone who’s spent quite a bit of their life in the area I know the author has done a wonderful job.) Slow it may be, but your heart will beat with adrenaline, love, pain, and heartache. Unearthly hints at the unending battle between good and evil and tantalizes readers with a taste of angelic mystery.

‘Porcelain is distinguished by its hardness resilience and translucence. It is made from Kaolin, a fine white clay mixed with ground petuntse, a clear glassy material. When fired at high temperatures the petuntse mets and surrounds the kaolin particles, forming a unified, vitreous object. This glassy quality gives porcelain tow of its most cherished qualities: its resonance—it rings when tapped and its translucence. It is often called china because of its Chinese origin.’

Ooooh, I just had a brilliant idea -- Germany is always going on with protesting all the Muslim immigrants they're getting, and how the German (read: white) birthrate is declining, and their country is filling up with camel jockeys, so why don't all the Germans just go and take over one of the countries in the Middle East? Then they can bitch about Jews and Muslims, and really mix it up over there by adding yet another player to the mix. Who am I kidding; they would totally get their asses kicked, and we don't need yet another language in the Middle East that sounds like you're trying to hawk up a loogie when you pronounce words.
This shot was a little more candid than the others.
º For some reason, Millard Fillmore, the 13th president, has been the butt of a lot of jokes over the years and I don’t know why. The guy seems pretty upstanding. When Fillmore moved into the White House, it didn’t have a Bible, so he corrected that oversight. He and his wife, Abigail, installed the first library at the White House, plus the first bathtub and kitchen stove. Fillmore could not read Latin and refused an honorary degree from Oxford University, saying a person shouldn’t accept a degree he could not read. (So how did the first 12 presidents take a bath?)
I’ve been recycling glass jars by slowly replacing the smaller plastic food containers we’ve been using. But, despite having my husband really go at that sticky residue, we just couldn’t get it all off. Enter the internet where I found various suggestions including peanut butter. I thought “Why not?” and gave it a try. Worked brilliantly! Smooth some on the jar, use a rag or one of those scrubber sponges to go over the area, and rinse. Who knew? (Apparently a lot of people – just not me.)

Mark Smith, Technical Director: “The Circuit de Catalunya is a track every team knows extremely well. We have already tested there twice this year as the layout gives the cars a good test of most of the track conditions we see throughout the season – fast, high G corners, a long straight and a number of slower speed corners where good traction is key. It is also one of the more technically demanding tracks for the drivers and offers a bit of everything. Turns 3 and 9 are high-speed corners and finding a balance for both together is not easy. The final sector is also a good challenge – the car has to make big changes of direction so you need good mechanical grip to maximise your lap time.”
Last week I mentioned my apathy towards marches and demonstrations and how it came about. I should have added, if only to balance things off a little, that I do have joined online campaigns and petitions. One of the reasons I feel proud to carry a British passport and call myself a "naturalised British citizen" is because this country has an efficient and fair health system where everyone, regardless of colour, sex, gender, sexual orientation or age can be treated without paying one single penny. Perfect, it is not, and I'd be the first one to say that a lot needs to be done. But let's not throw the baby with the bathwater. Increasing competition and changing the ways services are commissioned is not the solution. The result will be more inequality.

As far as performances go, I never expect anything less than the best from The Dirty Pearls. They pour with intensity, it's as if they actually run on "Caffeine and Gasoline" (track 3 on Whether You Like It Or Not, in case you were curious). Marty E., Dougie, Tommy, Sunny and Tommy London ripped through all their staple tracks including "New York City Is a Drug," "Sucker For a Sequel," "Static," "Luvsikluv," "Whether You Like It Or Not," and of course "Who's Coming Back To Who." After many promises from London about the album having no ballads, they relented and threw in "You Got Me Where You Want Me" at the last minute. As a dude who switches off his brain when bands perform ballads, I was enthralled by how cool this track is. I even fired up my Zippo lighter app on the iPhone. At one point soon after Tommy London thanked everyone for being there and mentioned that he read on his Twitter feed that there were people in the crowd who came from as far as Berlin, Germany and even...NEW JERSEY hahaha!!!

Using a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the all-purpose flour, bread flour, yeast, sugar, salt, water, and 5 of the eggs. Beat on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all the ingredients are combined. Stop the mixer, as needed, to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure all the flour is incorporated into the wet ingredients. Once the dough has come together, beat on low speed for another 3 to 4 minutes. The dough will be very stiff and seem quite dry.

The world cup was a very interesting part of the plot along with the tournment. I loved these because they were again something new. They both showed more of the world of wizardy which was really exciting. In the movie I remember the maze part and that was actually suspenseful with how it was shown which was different for Harry Potter. To me Harry Potter is for the kids and adults but it is always cheerful, never really suspenseful or even a little scary. This addition I thought was great to see.

Galileo made two mistakes. The first was one that many scientists make.

He invited anyone who wanted to see for themselves the truth, by looking through his telescope, to do just that.
On the positive side, what started as an annoying day filled with those out-of-body experiences and visiting abroad impasses turned into 100% happiness. The sky and tree blossoms were brilliant. I had a Nutella crepe. I met Michael on the Pont des Arts and we walked until we got to La Belle Hortense, where we caught up over wine until it was time to meet Mel at the Gilbert & George opening at Ropac. We passed Suzy Menkes in the street and then bumped into friends. The vernissage was jammed and fun. Then Mel and I went to Cafe Charlot, where the prices have skyrocketed and the food and service remain the same level of irresistibly mediocre, and it was all perfect.
The day after Mohamed Bezeid was taken to hospital, on Friday 11 February, a peaceful protest march by the ‘February 25′ activist movement was planned in Nouakchott. An hour before the scheduled start, three buses parked in a back street about 500 metres away from the advertised departure point were set on fire. There were no witnesses, but the fire was reported as an ‘arson attack’ by ‘unidentified youths’. Several social media commentators have speculated that it was more likely that the police or security forces themselves were responsible for the arson. Their logic is appealing: it would create an atmosphere of instability and lend credibility to the simultaneous police attack on the Art College of Nouakchott University, which resulted in 11 arrests; and also the subsequent police attacks on the peaceful ’February 25′ march, which were severe, disproportionate to the event itself, and resulted in dozens injured and 20 arrests . The point was also made that activists are unlikely to destroy their only means of public transport, and that anyone who did wish to burn public transport as a political statement would choose a time where there were no competing events, and a location that would allow a crowd to assemble.

"The term feminism can be used to describe a political, cultural, or economic movement aimed at establishing equal rights and legal protection for women."The "second wave" began in the early 1960s and lasted through the late 1980s. Some scholars say the second wave continues to exist alongside the "third wave" of feminism, which has already begun. I was called a Women's Libber during the "second wave" because I dared to speak up about sexism and the fact that women made less than men for doing the same work and could be told with impunity, "We don't hire women to do that." It didn't matter if women could do the job, maybe even better than the man hired. We were told, "Men have to support their families."

THe publication is very similar to the Typology+, reviewed HERE on urbanTick, by the same publisher. However the Manual is more the technical publication entirely (beside the bright orange) in black and white focusing on the organisation and the actual floor plan, where Typology+ presents the housing project as a building and in colour. They serve different purposes and therefore can happily, with overlaps, coexist.

Since 1996 the Convention of Bosniaks in North America has been held annually in cities such as Toronto, Chicago, New York, Seattle, St. Louis and Phoenix. This year, 10,000 Bosniaks from North America and Bosnia and Herzegovina will gather in Bowling Green between May 25 and May 27. The convention will feature a variety of social, music, culinary, religious and athletic events coupled with the dedication of the new Bosnian Islamic Center on Blue Level Road in Bowling Green.
Tomorrow is my birthday, the first Day of Spring! Usually the weather is crummy, cold rainy, or even snow. Not his year! Here in Chicago Land, we are having very unusually warm weather, It's been in the 70's to 80 for a whole week! Florida weather! Unbelievable! Because we are Chicagoans, we a little leary, that we still might have cold weather coming, but for now, we'll take it, and we're loving it. The trees are budding and the flowers are blooming, Yea! People are wearing flip top, shorts, and tank tops. Usually, This time of year, we are bundled up, wearing sweaters and winter coats.
When I met Richard last year I got to see a prototype of the "Norm" phone holder. He explained how they were working on the design and would be producing them at TechShop Menlo Park. I'm really glad to see that his business has come to fruition and hope more people follow his business model.

I’m sure many of you will have been in the position where you order a pint in an unfamiliar pub, and it comes out just borderline hazy, with a thin, scummy head, and a glass that is warm to the touch, and you just know before a drop passes your lips that it’s going to be crap. Clarity doesn’t guarantee a good pint, but for the general run of British ales, a lack of it is a sure sign of a poor one.
Everything on earth has changed. The air we breath now has a faster vibration to it, the ground we walk on… phew baby. It is like giving our mama mini orgasms every time we put our conscious foot onto her back. It is like a light field of explosive bliss. Who knew… I gotta do more walking otuside!!!

The first web definition I found of “bravado” conformed with my understanding:
Pfffft.
For all you wonderful men out there - fathers, uncles, grandfathers, mentors, teachers, coaches, good neighbors - who so positively impact the lives of children...
For Cora, New York holds the promise of discovery that might prove an answer to the question at the center of her being, and even as she does her best to watch over Louise in a strange and bustling city, she embarks on her own mission. And while what she finds isn’t what she anticipated, it liberates her in a way she could not have imagined. Over the course of the summer, Cora’s eyes are opened to the promise of the twentieth century and a new understanding of the possibilities for being fully alive."
With these reviews I simply want to point out those which you might want to consider, others which are helpful but not without fault, those which have no relevance at all, and others which contain grievous errors which should be avoided.
Speaking of baby monitor, this is THE BEST monitor in my humble opinion. Mark and I made a promise to each other that we would not let the babies sleep with us. This monitor allows me to see them, and hear every move they make. I sleep with it right beside me, so it really feels like they are right next to me at night. It's very comforting. I highly recommend this brand!

Building on the original theories of Nicolaus Copernicus from 1543, scientists were able to predict and record the transits of both Mercury and Venus in the centuries that followed.
Bri and her mom decide to put the baby bed together. Somehow this ends up with Bri having a bloody toe and MTV decides to show a fairly gnarly close up. For - in my mind - what seems like an extended amount of time. WHY, MTV? WHY? Bloody feet gross me out more than anything else in the world and I'm tempted to turn the channel. The bloody toe (*harf*) evolves into a discussion about all the disgusting things babies do. Sister Britt is in the room at this point and the conversation turns to her abortion and how she can't ever take it back. There are tears, on her part, as she explains it's hard to watch Briana go through pregnancy. She knows it'll be hard seeing Bri with the baby as well. There's a lot of tension between the sisters. Part of me feels sorry for Brittany and I wish we knew a little more about her story. Did she feel forced into abortion? Did she feel it was her only alternative? On the other hand, she needs to just stop taking it out on Bri that Bri decided to keep her baby.
This reminds me of Proverbs 14:9. “Fools make a mock at sin.” Paul confirms this in Colossians 1:18. “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness.” If Paul is present when the Lord pronounces judgment upon the unbelievers, he can truly say, “Ye should have hearkened unto me.”

I think WvW will be a more satisfactory experience of inter-player combat for me as the systems have been set up to allow, at one end, large groups of people (such as organised guilds) to co-ordinate huge raids on enemy keeps all the way to the other end where small teams of casual players can take out or defend supply lines. As I see myself firmly at the casual end of that spectrum, I am *really* excited by this as it means I can take part in the war rather than finding myself ignored by the cool kids and left on the bench like the wheezy kid in a school PE lesson.

We are almost out of my very favorite time of year, and it is time to send out our Yearly Greetings to Special Family and Friends!!! I have now decided to take one stress off of myself and start sending our Annual Christmas letter as a New Year’s Letter from now on. December is just so busy with 4 little ones and I never seem to get the letter and card ready to mail out until Christmas or a few days later so instead we will do a New Year’s letter and that will be more FUN for me!!! I did not make this decision until after I had created and had our Christmas Card for the Year printed up, so it still says Merry Christmas :)

After trimming off as much of the external fat as possible, I cut the brisket into three large chunks (mostly so that it would fit into my crockpot, but also to ensure even cooking) and covered it with the barbecue sauce. I refrigerated mine overnight at this point. If you've got the time, you could also just throw it all together in the morning and cook it right away.
In hopes that the agent would be interested in my manuscript, and assuming I had to shorten the manuscript to make it publishable anyway, I started cutting. Of course, the thing about cutting down is that it's unlikely you can keep your changes to deletions; more likely you'll be editing and reshaping as you go.
Thirty years ago you might have found me reading under the covers. Nothing too shameful - Orwell perhaps, Dickens or Mills and Boon historical. I don't have to hide under the covers any more, but the sense of indulging guilty pleasures still persists. This is with good reason since I should be finishing my essay on Victorian deathbed scenes but hey, everyone deserves a break now and then.

Guessing it was a mint or candy of some type, I stopped the lesson, looked directly at them and waited. I was 3 feet away and still she tried to unburden herself knowing I was watching. I announced, "Well ---, go ahead and give it to ---- so we can all move on." "Really? Ok," she replied and handed him an intricately folded piece of paper.

Some things about writing Sliding on the Edge: I researched until I was buried in notes about self-abuse and suicide. I learned a lot that I hadn't expected to learn, and since learning new stuff is always exciting, this experience whetted my appetite to continue doing something that required research and organizing that research within a story so it was "enjoyable." (Whew! Long sentence.) Another interesting thing: I was surprised when readers asked me about my own self-abuse. That was really a surprise to discover that people thought I'd written from personal experience.
Karen brings up the fact that Sting wrote “They Dance Alone”, a tune heavily critical of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. She contrasts it with Sting’s decision to play a concert for Gulnara Karimov. I think it comes down to Sting’s liberal politics.
The path of karma is very intricate; therefore we should understand the distinctions between karma, akarma and vikarma. If we simply engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything becomes clear. Otherwise we will have to make distinctions between what we should do and what we should not do in order not to become entangled. In the ordinary course of life we unknowingly break some law and have to suffer the consequences. Similarly, the laws of nature are very strict and stringent, and they accept no excuse. It is a law of nature that fire burns, and even if a child touches it, he will be burned despite his ignorance and innocence. Thus we have to choose our course of action very carefully lest the stringent laws of nature react to bind us to suffering. It is therefore necessary to understand what work to do and what work to avoid.
Combat in this series is fairly standard, a ‘roll’ is done to determine who goes first and from there is it standard RPG fair. Players cannot attack until there meter fills up with item use being the shortest and special attacks taking the longest, standard attacks being the middle. A characters speed will also determine how long it takes for them to prepare an attack. Enemies have various weaknesses and resistances but some of them come out of the blue, for instance mimes are impervious to special attacks but weak to basic ones.

Never mix the lye and water in the same area where my dogs or cats (or kids, of course) are. I always mix my lye and water in the basement and wait until the fumes have completely dissipated before I bring it upstairs to use in the kitchen. It is also a good idea to keep your pets gated out of the area in which you are going to work, just in case there's a spill.

Rivet the pieces and form the ear wire. Feed the three copper disks onto the 20-gauge copper wire. We used the large copper disk as the back piece, a brass disk as the middle piece and the sterling silver disk as the front piece. This design gave a three color look but maximized the sterling silver.

It’s very difficult to pull off rock music in films, with almost all of them missing the mark because the music simply isn’t good enough. Rock films depend on the audience being carried away by the power of the music, which to my mind has only happened twice:
Recently, I had a discussion with a lady about violence in children’s books. She believed that Witchfinder had overstepped the mark in the horror stakes (no pun intended!), but I think that this idea that kids are sensitive little buttercups who can’t handle the harsh realities (or unrealities) of life is just nonsense. I believe that we forget how resilient we were as children. Grown-ups look back and think that we hit 18 and suddenly develop a worldly resistance to the horrors of life. Rubbish. We’ve been developing that resistance and fortitude since birth. We forget just how advanced we were in this respect at the ages of 10, 11, 12, 13. Horror stories can be a learning tool in this regard. They are a great way of developing this vital life skill of resilience within a safe environment. This is hardly an original thought: the Brothers Grimm were doing the same thing with their cannibalistic witches and bloodthirsty ogres over 200 years ago! Now those stories are seen as classic literature, but are they any less gruesome than Darren Shan? Horror stories and grim(m) fairytales are often allegories, preparing us for the true horrors of the adult world. As such, they must be truly, and hopefully enjoyably, terrifying!

As great as the art and the adventure was, this one was not without some flaws. I felt like some of the pages were over burdened with too much text, which did two negative things: covered up the art, and slowed down the flow of the story. Another thing that bothered me a bit was that the ending felt really abrupt. This could have easily been twice as long as the 64 pages it chimes in at. When I had turned the last page I felt a little bit cheated. My first thought was that there's got to be a sequel, but from what I can uncover from research, it looks like this is all I'll be getting. It is kinda fun to imagine for myself what happens to the characters after the last page is turned, but I would have been happier with more material.

Aah those Sindh mountains we saw driving through the desert - where the University of Sindh appears like an oasis, and the Indus River, a diminishing gift. Dreams should always land up in desert mountains, and drained to the sea. So majestic and serene; their heat could suffocate. We see the historic city of Bhubak. We wet our feet in Sindhu. We stop at the tomb of Shabaz Qalander at Sehwan. I like that Sufis blended religions to appeal to their followers' tastes, but this is just a racket now. Hundreds lie in the stench of the shrine waiting for biryanis to be handed out. After seeing a community gaunt from water starvation, this display of generosity (and gluttony) is vile. It does not feel spiritual. We quickly give fifty rupee notes to faqirs who pray for us and handle us as like veteran hustlers. There is no god to be found here. No need to pray so hard. There are people living without water and on cracked earth, while the duffers will have their golf courses. We all are a little bit mad. Years ago, as children, we visited Haleji Lake. Those were the good days for that lake too, and I remember meeting a family. We gave them saunf and talked to them for hours; they seemed very poor. The father said his daughter was pulled by a crocodile while she washed clothes by the edge. His face still haunts me. That croc is an endangered species too.
So, I haven't been writing here much lately. Actually, it's been a month since I wrote anything at all! Part of that reason was the Summer Montreal Unschoolers Gathering (which was really wonderful. I'd write a post about it except I didn't take any pictures, and just words seems like it would be boring...). But most of the reasons I haven't been writing here lately are the same reasons I haven't been writing all that much in the last several months: writers block, not being able to find topics that really catch my fancy, trying to focus on things not related to computers... And largely, not feeling able to talk about what I'm feeling on this blog.

If the look you are striving to achieve comes in the form of a $200.00 goblet, it's no wonder you've had a chip on your shoulder. In order to achieve the look of a super expensive style, sometimes it's necessary to raise your budget just a tad. Don't get me wrong; $100.00 is still a lot to spend on a wine glass. But, if what you originally had your eye on is more than double the price, then that second option might not look so bad. These next two crystal comparisons are so aesthetically similar that even your status conscious friends won't be able to distinguish between the two!

There are only about fifty Honus Wagner's cards but most of them are in poor condition. Wagner did not want his image on a tobacco card and was therefore removed from the set which already make his card harder to obtain. The book is about the one known as The Card. Once owned by hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, this card is in excellent condition and that's the problem. The Card is possibly in too good condition. You can refinish classic antiques and paintings get retouched but baseball cards must not be altered. There are card doctors who remove stains, smooth out wrinkles, build up soft corners, change memorabilia patches, and laser rough edges. The book explores the serious doubts about the authenticity of The Card and its current condition.

Nigerians must be surprised by the astonishing claims made by the Presidential aide on MDGs, as nothing is visible on ground to justify such claims. Her approach to the matter, and the wide claims, were completely off the mark. The ambivalence of Dr. Gbeneol on the issue of poverty reduction as it relates to the MDGs, clearly shows that such a policy, if at all it exists, is not well-thought through. It was therefore no surprise that she could not give specific details on the policy.

They tried to shove their way in but I somehow got the door closed and locked and I bolted up the stairs to call my mother’s office.

When we were looking around for somewhere to move into for the summer we commented on the amount of open space around the apartment and mentioned that it would be good for Ady to have somewhere to run around. The landlord was right there and he quickly told us that she shouldn't be allowed to run around unsupervised. His tone wasn't suggesting that we wouldn't watch her, or that she would cause problems so I looked at him somewhat curiously. He then went on to inform us that wolves and bears in the area make it unsafe for children to just play outside unsupervised. We left the appointment and were discussing how odd a comment that was, and were sure that we'd never heard that line before when looking at an apartment. Kasey of course was worrying and asking me how many bears are in the area, do we need to worry much, do you think we'll ever see one, how many people get attacked each year... I immediately began to inform her that bear sightings are rare, and we'll probably never see a bear or wolf, and the guy was a little off his rocker. Just as I got done saying this I had to slam on my brakes as a bear came out of the woods in front of us and crossed the highway. Two days later I had to slow down for a wolf. I guess in Northern Minnesota you keep an eye on your kids when they are outdoors, and one eye on the woods.

This silent afternoon heat is different from the sweet morning when blossoms of stargazer lily perfumed the air. It’s the summer afternoon we’ve been waiting for all year – earth heated and air still, only the tiniest breeze. Clothes bake stiff on the line. It’s quiet because it is hot, and quiet because it’s too hot to fuss – too dry to transplant or plant. Grass grows dormant.

First, lets talk about what I wanted. I wanted number three. Like really really wanted. I loved the natural feeling. I loved the color {especially with our floors}. I loved that it fit. I didn't love the $35 price tag which would make the total cost of filling the cubbies, $350!!! No thank you. So, I looked at number one as an alternative. Coming in at $13 per basket, I would still be able to fill the cubbies and get that natural texture and feeling I was going for. But again, $130 total and I wasn't quite sure that woven baskets would be the best option for a play space. I love the look and natural feeling, but I just wasn't convinced that for $130 they would stand the test of playroom time. Next option was also IKEA, number two. They are made for the Expedit, so I know they hold boatloads of toys. In fact, in our past playroom, we had some of these. But, they were large, clunky, heavy and ultimately cracked and chipped quite easily. Total for number two would be an even $100. I almost pulled the trigger on number four. We have some of these in Expedits in the boy's shared closet and LOVE them. Canvas, durable, fit the Expedit perfectly.... I was sold. I even almost paid the $100 price tag for ten of these babies. But, they were completely sold out {and still are}. Boo. Leaving us with number five. I have used this type of basket around the house a few times, and we really really love them. I love the texture and the durability. They are really super fantastic baskets. I had been eying them up for awhile, but at $12 per basket, I was having a hard time taking the $120 plunge. But then last week I spied a pretty little clearance sticker on the bottom of those bad boys. $6 for the giant size that I needed? Heck YES! My Target store only had two in stock. So this crazy lady may have driven to multiple Target stores to snag all ten clearance baskets....
Jesus and the disciples spend the night back in Bethany, and the next morning head to Jerusalem again. They pass the same fig tree as the day before, and Peter exclaims that the tree is withered all the way down to the roots. Jesus tells him that if he has faith in God, “and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen” then he can tell a mountain to move and it will. “Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive your sins.”

He said his favourite tool to track the impact and reach of tweets is Tweetreach. I totally agree – I listed it as one of my ten favourite Twitter reporting and analysis tools in a previous post. I used it when the Crime Reports app was first launched, and noted at the time how the reach could be increased through organisations and individuals retweeting each other in a coordinated way.

Once the pretext stop was made, Reichert claimed that Zambrana and his passenger appeared “nervous” – which is an entirely understandable reaction to the presence of an armed stranger who considers himself entitled to kill you at his discretion. He then barraged them with what Judge Reagan called a series of “rolling no” questions. This is a tactic designed to elicit permission to search the vehicle. After inquiring about drugs, weapons, or cash, and getting negative responses, the officer will pose some variation of this question: “Hey, this will only take a minute – do you mind if I just take a look before letting

My husband knows its trouble when I start a conversation with "So... Ive been thinking..."; I have ended that conversation with really whoppers like: "we should move out of the city and buy a house", "I should quit my job and go back to school", "we should have a baby", "we should start a big house project 1 month before our baby is due"...

And your wishes will come to pass and to become true. Say your words. Speak them.

Am I dour? What does ‘dour’ even mean. Stern? Laconic? (Surely not?) Awkward? Or is dour a part I play when I’m online to entertain the troops? That I do it so well suggests that there might be some truth to the rumour – and I throw my hand up right now and admit to being a grumpy pig at times especially when tired – but I’m not so sure I am actually dour. Dour is not a switch or if it is it’s more like a dimmer switch than an on/off switch. Would a dour bugger stick on The Best... Album in the World...Ever! and crank up the volume while he cleaned the flat in preparation for his wife’s return from the States?
K, so we have been pretty busy. Jeff took a contact job with the great guys who he met when were in TN. Now these guys have given him the opportunity to do some great work and write a bit in corporate speak. What that means for us is two fold (or more) : First, it means we get to be here in the beautiful Pacific Northwest as a *family* at home for a few more months without worry. Second, it means we got to go to San Diego with him and see our peeps down there. So this month has been jammin' with thoughts and work and ideas and activities.
Joel: There are really only three characters in the book, but my favorite is Tommy's friend, Vince, who is Cambodian-American with a prosthetic leg who also plays football.

Everyone ages. There will come a point as we age that we may lose the ability to take care of ourselves. When it comes to this time, it is generally a good idea to think about moving into a nursing home. Nursing homes present a situation that may not be ideal, but can offer a good option for personal care. These facilities employ licensed professionals to help residents with a high quality of care.

While I'm not in the mood for making cards as such, I thought I'd start decorating my pile of blank boxes. Most of these boxes are a result of mis-measuring and getting sizes wrong for the stuff that I want to put in them. Others are from when I've forgotten to cut the card for the lids bigger ( always 3mm to get a good fit ) than the bottom and having loads of half boxes waiting for other halves to be made.

I have to say: First, I thought even the full quotation not a good choice: It is not among King’s greatest remarks (others of which likewise are not absolutely original). Above all, though, unlike many others, it does not stand well on its own and really loses a great deal without the context of the sermon.

Unfortunately upon retirement in December 2010, due to the sophisticated nature of the aircraft and the highly sensitive nature of the avionics used and an associated agreement with the United States the majority of F-111′s had to be disposed of.

While this language doesn't support the DNC's argument about a mandate, it's the same type of argument that conservatives are litigating against in Obamacare. They say the withholding of Medicaid payments unless states expand the program is illegal control of the state governments by the federal government, and that's exactly what Romney wanted to do with the mandate program - require states to impose mandates or lose their funding. While this argument isn't expected to do very well, the Supreme Court decided to consider it.

Well, it means that Melchizedek was a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. It does not mean that he was Jesus Christ, as some like to argue, but that in certain ways he is a pre-Christ picture of who Christ is. First, Melchizedek is not introduced with a genealogy showing how he meets the legal requirements to be a priest. He is not a descendant of the tribe of Levi, which the Mosaic Law requires for priesthood. In this way, Jesus Christ is like Melchizedek. Christ is not a descendant of the tribe of Levi. He is from the line of Judah. Christ’s priesthood transcends the Law, as does Melchizedek’s.

2. The one or two tanda rule: Unless you plan on saying, "sleeping with me is an option," do not dance more than two tandas in a row. Make it one -- even better. Thank each other and get off the floor at the cortina. If you really liked dancing, make it clear that you would like another dance later on. Fellow blogger, Terpsichoral, tells me that in Buenos Aires one clears the floor, and that dancing more than one tanda is rare. Hmm, I wonder why! Buenos Aires is full of Tomcats, she says, but that's okay because the women know how to manage these furry creatures. Exactly my point! I am not out to neuter Tango Tomcats, just help communities neutralize them!

Well, I guess it's finally time to do this, Brutus. I've really been dreading writing down all of my feelings about this race because part of me feels so grateful to have finished marathon #4 in one piece, and the other part of me wishes I could go back in time and change things. Mainly the weather. Running is such an individual sport, so I know that some of you might hate me for complaining about this race and my time, just like I get annoyed by people who complain about their 3:30 marathon times. But I knew that I was capable of more and to not dig deep enough to find that little bit more of whatever it is I'm digging for is disappointing. So yes, I know that my time is totally fine, but I am not totally fine with it. You know? I'm going to just write the same sentence over and over until it comes out sounding normal. Nah, I think I'll end it there. You guys get it.

The theater was pretty nice — nothing fancy or special about it, actually. There weren’t any previews — or those “Silence is Golden” ads — and the movie started right away. To my relief, the movie wasn’t dubbed in Korean (because, well, let’s be real: there was maybe a 10% chance of it or something) but there were Korean subtitles at the bottom — a lot like those bootleg movie cams you can download. However, Korean movie etiquette is quite different here: a bunch of people were on their phones a lot during the movie, and one dude even had a phone call and didn’t hesitate to answer it and start his phone conversation. I was tempted to throw my empty food containers at him and cuss him out:
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust; the simple phrase that anyone can relate to the ultimate end of one’s physical body. In a world where children, young men and women across the world have seen so much of death in such a short period of time, many of us still fear it. It is the great unknown. The sphere of departure.
We die because we are alive. Living means birth and death. Creation and destruction signify life.

As a concept, Brave New World is hands-down, no-holds-barred awesome. As a novel, it’s pretty okay. There are times when Huxley’s narrative style varies so much from chapter to chapter that you wonder if the man wasn’t himself on a little soma, if you know what I mean. His characters are intriguing, though I would argue not entirely developed, and the arc of the story leaves something to be desired.

Once my legs could bear it no more I came back inside. We call the website we ordered from which is a middle man for tons of restaurants in Denmark (http://www.just-eat.dk). They have live chat support and thankfully we got someone who did speak English. They called the restaurant then explained they had left the food outside, by our camping van…but we don’t have a camping van. So the middleman phones the restaurant back and they agree to send out a new order of food.

Naturally, all of us want to help our kids, all of us want to keep our kids safe. But only recently has “good parenting” become synonymous with “constant hovering.” Why do we think kids suddenly need that? Our children are just as competent as we were. If we could organize a kickball game, they can organize a kickball game. If we could walk to school, they can walk to school. And though it feels very hard to believe, our kids are just as safe as we were, too. Safer, actually, if you grew up in the ’70s or ’80s. Crime was going up during those years and it peaked in about 1993. Since then it has been plummeting — and not because we’re keeping kids inside. ALL VIOLENT CRIME is down in the States — including against adults. It is just a safer country, crime-wise, than it was when we were growing up.

The first notice targeted the “Falun Gong Research Society” as an organization, rather than Falun Gong itself. In fact, that ban itself does not stand up. Falun Gong, after approval from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society in 1993, was absorbed as a subordinate entity called the “Falun Gong Research Branch.” Mr. Li Hongzhi concluded the teaching of the practice in Mainland China and outside of China in December 1994 and 1995, respectively. From that point on, Mr. Li focused on research of the Buddha Law and stopped the activity of giving Qigong classes. Accordingly, the Falun Gong Research Society formally petitioned for withdrawal from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society in March of 1996, and upon approval from the Chinese Qigong Scientific Research Society, completed the procedures for its dissolution from the research society. Thus, the Falun Gong Research Society ceased to exist from that point on. How could an entity that was dissolved in March of 1996 be banned in July of 1999?

So how do we avoid these pitfalls? Let's try re-thinking our goals as a parents. One of my goals as a parent is to allow my kids to be as happy as they are capable of being, doing whatever it is that makes them happiest. Another goal is to empower my kids to choose happiness, by giving them as much control over their lives as I can, now, even while they are only two and four years old. I am hoping that the way my husband and I treat our kids will help them figure out what makes them tick and what they want out of life and how to get it.

One day in the early nineties her husband came home with a desktop computer and sat her in front of it. “Now you have no more excuses,” he said, and she realized the truth in his words. Procrastination, now no longer an option, she took off on the pursuit of penning her first book. Though that book, a young adult fantasy, was lost due to unforeseen circumstances, she kept going, writing a historical romance, and another YA.

Just last week, a foreign question popped into my mind: Will I someday grow too old to tell stories for children? I am, after all, going to turn 35 this month. Almost as quickly as the question showed up, the answer nearly bowled me over. No way! Some things are as deeply ingrained as breathing and walking and laughing.
There is a growing fascination today with angels. These men were angels and they were dressed in white apparel. Who were they? They were messengers from God, angels. Who are angels? What is their sex? Every time we find angels mentioned in the Bible, they are men, never women. They were men who came to visit Abraham. They were men who came to report to God in Job chapter one. They were called the “sons of God.” Even the fallen angels mentioned in Genesis 6 were called the “sons of God.” Today you find that angels are always women. Why? Because they are not the holy angels sent from God but the fallen angels, those who followed and still follow Satan in his deceptive activity. God is not the author of confusion but Satan uses confusion all the time.

But the coordinator had better things to do than get into the nitty-gritty of names. What’s in a name anyway? So there I was, serving the community as a library grandparent for two years.

Anarchists stand against vanguardism. They are advocates of direct action, though they understand this in a variety of ways and adopt very different attitudes to questions of violence, disobedience and protest. Because they reject institutional politics, anarchists are often dismissed as hopeless idealists. Anyone prepared to engage with the order that anarchists see at the heart of anarchy will find this a strange reversal.
What is it that makes people shy away from the gut wrenching? And I don't mean watching a sad movie or the news. I mean the real grit and dirt of life. What is it that makes people flinch from real things? Things like real love, passion, having babies, death, spirituality, ethics, race, people... the list could go on and on. And it isn't the discussing of these things so much as the living of them. Talk is cheap. (See what I mean about cliches? That is a good one.)

We were all gutted when Hull scored their winner but Stoke could have done no more than win. Now we just have to get a draw at home to Leicester. Will we do it? Yes.

Actually, the way things pop up again or get worked in? I think this works better in a DVD set, where you can sit back and watch several episodes in a row because that way you pick up on the little things. Waiting a week, I think you'd miss those little details. Also, because sometimes this show is so quick, and so jam packed, you want to rewatch an episode or a scene right away to get the full, rich experience.
One person died in the raid. The suspected hide out – a house – was pulled down. Guns, explosives and ammunition were recovered.
There was another hill once, and another ruined house, from which I date my interest not only in lonely hilltops but the mysterious subject of balloon flight. I was a city girl who had gone to get away from it all in a tiny cottage overlooking Worcestershire’s Teme Valley. Much of what Bonnie felt about her strange new world I felt about this place. No road ran within at least a mile of my cottage, and nobody had lived in it for many years. It was a two-up-two-down, with a pig pen out the back, water up the field in a tap next to a cattle trough and no electricity, which meant I cooked on an old range fuelled by logs collected from a nearby wood. My days were ruled by the sun. When it rose I did as well; when it went down it was time for bed. But that was fine by me because I wasn’t there for domestic ease, I was there to write. Every day I’d sit out in the damson orchard in front of my cobbled-together, packing-case desk and clatter away happily on my aged Adler typewriter. I never saw another soul, except for my husband who was there to paint, and the only transport I ever saw was a tractor on a distant field and a hot air balloon which one day flew overhead.
Oh, your little personality. You are quite a strong-willed, determined little girl! And I know you got that from me, as my mom said I was just like you when I was a little girl. You can have quite a temper too. You always want to do things by yourself, and if we try to help you out, you flail your arms up and down like you’re trying to say, “I can do it myself!” Recently, you’ve started arching your back, throwing your head back and making your body really stiff if we try to help you with something or ask you to do something you don’t want to do. Oh goodness.
After seeing Drive (2011) and Valhalla Rising (2009), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn I was expecting the same kind of smooth beauty in the direction. That didn’t really happen in this one. There’s gritty as a genre and there’s gritty in the filming and this is the latter. It’s the former as well come to think of it, but that’s to be expected. This was far weaker in film quality. I’m sure that’s meant to convey a message, but it conflicts with his own direction style which is to convey more with film than dialogue.

In the first world countries, many of the parents of today have had music tuition at some stage in their lives. If you look at Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, England, Italy, USA, to name only a few examples, hundreds of children are performing and composing music by the time they reach High School. Playing an instrument develops parts of the brain, co-ordination and small motor skills like no other activity does. It encourages discipline and social interaction and brings much joy to themselves and family members, as whole families play together at home as part of their family inter action. No money can buy family time.
First of all, I have to mention that I saw NKOTB in all of their retro glory again last night. Basically a few tweaks of their first tour but the addition of Popsicle made my friend Sara's night! I will post pics whenever I get home. Again I screamed like I was 9 again and danced around with a bunch of my friends. It was awesome. The night was made complete by the drive by of Waffle House to see all of the silly 20 and 30 something women hoping that the boys (I mean, men) would be dropping by. It was literally a crowded House. Oh, and Donnie or D Dub as you are now called, please stop making the smarmy comments about getting with little girls moms and us having boobs now. It is creeping us out. As Ashley put it, our 9 year old selves are here not our 28 or 29 year old selves. We're too young to hear this kind of talk. Thanks-love you!

Speaking of which, the ending inspired in me such anger, anxiety, and various negative emotions within me – after finishing the book, I sat there for a whole twenty minutes, blabbing on about a lack of closure and how my copy must have been damaged because that seriously could not have been the ending. But, unfortunately, it was – and I’m fairly sure that it was intended to be as lacking in closure and lacking in mercy as it was. To some extent, it was happy and sufficient, but to another extent, it felt incomplete, like the author had taken the easy way out. It was just … disheartening, I suppose, that the ending was so vague whereas everything had been so lovingly detailed.

The first half passes and Rachel’s role develops wonderfully. Character of Paige has shown a lot of depth than in the first 30 minutes of the movie. Now, you start feeling connected to the film. You can feel that confusion that Paige feels when he looks at Leo, who claims to be her husband. But she remembers nothing about him. You can feel her trying her best not to hurt him. Even Channing’s character picks up the pace and develops as events start happening. Channing beautifully portrays Leo’s helplessness, which he feels when his wife leaves him out. You can feel Leo’s agony and frustration when he is cut off by the love of his life, as she remembers only the period before she met him. That awkwardness is well displayed between a husband and wife who were soul mates a while ago but have to live as strangers now.
When I was a senior in high school, I bought tickets to see REM. I spent a good $40 of my money on a general admission ticket, and this was 17 years ago. My love affair with Michael Stipe and Peter Buck began on a plane somewhere between San Francisco and Salt Lake City. I was meeting my family for a ski trip in Utah, and I had the Out of Time cassette playing over and over in my yellow Walkman Sport, which was held together with a large blue rubber band.
Any claim to the superiority of faith over evidence and reason can’t be disproven by evidence and reason. This is why—in the short term anyway—atheists can only reach believers who are susceptible to rational argument. True believers literally don’t care about evidence and reason (although they might use it in an attempt to persuade the ignorant). For example, if it were possible to prove conclusively that the entire Bible was written by some prankster, it wouldn’t matter in the least to them. They would just say, “That was how God chose to bring us his word,” or, “God allowed Satan to create false evidence in order to test the faithful.” Afterwards, they would believe even more strongly than before. Faith isn’t just belief in the absence of evidence; faith is belief despite the evidence.

“The Lord is my shepherd” acknowledges my weakness and my need for a heavenly caregiver. Every child delights in Psalm 100. Who doesn’t want to “Shout to the Lord”? “Don’t be upset with evil people” comforts all of us because we struggle with wickedness that stems from others in our lives. “Sing to the Lord” speaks of the joy that the Lord wants us to experience.
I was one of them. I met Michael in the men's room at the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, during one of his mass tastings that was part of The Book & The Cook. It was before I even knew what TB&TC was; Michael Jackson was in town doing a beer tasting, what else did I need to know? After the tasting (yes, I took notes, and still have them), Jackson was signing books and I overheard someone asking him a question about "stock ale," in the context of the Samuel Adams Boston Ale, then sub-labeled as a stock ale. MJ gave a somewhat circuitous answer that left me still curious (At a TB&TC press breakfast years later, I told him I admired how he took questions, any question, from a beer audience and answered in detail. "It's simple," he told me. "If I don't know the answer, I take a sentence or two to speculate, another sentence to note what other subject that brings up, and then I just answer the question I want to answer.").
I don’t need to provide a detailed list of incentives to get your partner to display the desired actions. Use your imagination, based on what you know (or learn) about what motivates them. Dogs are motivated by attention and treats. A man may be motivated by a new sexy lingerie, where as a woman may be motivated by flowers delivered to her office once a month. That brings me to one more crucial point. This technique only works if both people have the desire to please the other person. As heartbreaking as it might be, if your partner does not show any indication of doing what it takes to show you the behavior you need for fulfillment, it may be time to consider finding a partner who does have that desire. You can only train a dog, or human, who has the desire to be trained. But the responsibility is yours and yours alone to let your partner, friend, colleague or whomever what it is that you want and need. If you have a hard time answering that question, begin by asking yourself what makes you smile. If that doesn’t start providing some answers, take the love language test in Mr. Chapman’s book to give you some ideas.
There are two important parables that back up this reality. This first even raises the ante by saying that we must forgive from the heart:
But this can't be placed entirely at the feet of faceless bureaucracy. The football program was too beloved of the general public, too protected by sentiment, for a proper sense of shame to make any sort of impression upon those with wickedness brewing rot in their hearts. Sports should not occupy such a ritualized , pseudo-religious niche in the folkways of a healthy society. Is it because there's a lack of public religion in this college environment? Honestly, I don't know - I'm such an agnostic, I'm seriously detached from the religious life of the community. The football game pilgrimage was the one thing that united the increasingly-leftwing university/student community and the middle-of-the-road nonpolitical-sort-of-conservative alumni and county communities outside of the Centre Region townships and the borough.

As the solstice nears, our solar system is entering a different part of the galaxy, a new spectrum of vibration. Higher frequency energy is pouring into the existing energy field of the planet.

While these concerns may be legitimate, I think that the church desperately needs to discern how best to go about influencing our secular culture. Often I find that the message is compromised by the method being used. There are too many examples of Christians resorting to militant behavior. Change is sought by trying to leverage power and coerce others into following suit.
I want to show off some of my busy-ness.
We got into the examination room and she did great looking through all the various devices and doing what she was told. Then came time for the eye drops. I had attempted to prepare the staff about Katie. When I called to make the appointment I had told them that she has autism and that she does not like having her face/head messed with. I TOLD them that putting in the eye drops to dilate her eyes was going to be an issue. “Oh don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” Well, you haven’t dealt with MY kid. When we arrived at the appointment, I reminded them, “My daughter has autism and she doesn’t like having her face messed with. The eye drops are going to be a problem.” Again, “Oh, don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” *sigh* When it came time for the eye drops, I told the assistant, “Katie has autism. She does not like having her face messed with. This is going to be a challenge.” “Oh, it will be fine. I work with kids all the time.” What happened next was straight out of a time passed where they tortured patients at hospitals… They laid her back in the chair and I could see her beginning to panic. Then, the assistant came to stand over her and tried talking to her. The hands came up to the face and the yelling/crying began. Katie is a very vocal and verbal child. She is FULLY capable of relating to those around her how much she dislikes a situation, and she did just that. I stood back and watched in absolute horror/vindication. I tried to tell them! I mostly stood by to see the man struggle with the situation, but I finally took pity on him and I went over to help by holding her hands down. I told her over and over again, “Let the man do his job. You need to have these eye drops to make sure your eyes are healthy.” All the while getting louder and louder. She was also getting louder and louder. I can only imagine what the people in the other exam rooms were thinking. Now, since her hands were pinned down, she scrunched her eyes up. The poor man (kid really) tried to get the drops in. He had us go out to the waiting room while the drops did their stuff. Poor Katie was all red from crying and she was all sweaty from the stress the whole situation had caused her. But, she was happy to be done with it all and enjoyed looking at all the glasses. After about twenty minutes, the man (kid) came back to check her eyes… We had to try the drops again. The first go round didn’t take. *FUCK*
2006: Pujols (2nd)
When I could I spent us much time near the tree-line as possible, staring in. I watched the Guardians fight when the occasional wolf came to steal a chicken. I practised the movements they used with a long stick. My coming of age was close approaching. I’d need all the knowledge I could get. I had become determined… infatuated with the idea of making it through the Forest. I dreamed of what lie on the other-side. For me it was always some kind of paradise. Warmth, and a treeless clearing stretching for miles. Hills of grass as far as the eye could see.
Good M’s offensive, good M’s defense, smart moves by the coaches. In the last couple of years, the M’s have been so crippled, so disappointing, the games haven’t even really been worth it. But tonight, home alone on a Friday night, I was really really enjoying this game.
A minute later he returned with another bowl of soup. He warned her not to do it again, and placed the bowl on the table. She went beserk trying to attack him with her fist. Her effort was pathetic, screaming through tears for him to just kill her and be done with it. Tired of her outburst he backhanded her across the face. Her eyes danced in their sockets. Ehausted she slumped forward and sobbed uncontrollable.
The real highlight of this post though... I actually had the opportunity to have breakfast with Martha Stewart yesterday--yes, the Martha Stewart. I don't like to talk in too much detail about my full-time gig, but this breakfast was a spectacular moment made possible through my job as a magazine advertising buyer. And given the subject matter I cover here in my blog, I had to share this experience with you all!
Peter was never outside. Only one time (in 4 weeks) when we were walking around the building did we see him. He was sitting in a small ambulance-car on a caregiver's lap, probably ready to leave for a medical appointment. The door was open. He was smaller than I thought he would be. I didn't want to stare and get in trouble, but that was the only time I saw him.

About the only negative thing I have to say about this book is that it’s almost certainly doomed to have a very limited appeal. Unless you’re a giant Diablo lore geek, a collector, or an aficionado of sepia tone drawings, there’s very little reason for you to pick up “The Book of Cain.”

Recently, Helen asked me to make cookies again, this time for a bridal shower she was planning for her friend. She initially wanted "I" and "I" cookies (for Irene and Ivan), but after I saw their wedding website, which had a floral theme, I sent Helen a picture of my flower cookies which I had just made for a friend's daughter's birthday party. We decided that I would do half of them flower cookies, and half of them "I" cookies, in the bride's color scheme of vintage pink, cream, and yellow.

I asked if she knew what happened next, and she didn’t grasp what I was fishing for. She told me she and her father had something to eat and went home. And she knew from that day that the voyage to Australia would be safe, and so it had been.

My first Mother's Day was quiet, but lovely. We slept in and then CB made me lunchfast, which consisted of pancakes with maple syrup from Quebec (yum!) bacon, strawberries and cinnamon scones. So tasty! We enjoyed a nice afternoon stroll with the baby and Loki (who is two years old today! Big day around these parts...) and headed to CB's parents' house for a BBQ. They are great! They babysat the baby for us while we attended our friends' fabulous wedding yesterday. First major outing out without the monster!

Worship is giving God the best that He has given you. Be careful what you do with the best you have. Whenever you get a blessing from God, give it back to Him as a love-gift. Take time to meditate before God and offer the blessing back to Him in a deliberate act of worship. If you hoard it for yourself, it will turn into spiritual dry rot, as the manna did when it was hoarded (see Exodus 16:20). God will never allow you to keep a spiritual blessing completely for yourself. It must be given back to Him so that He can make it a blessing to others.
So, we went to MCS, then took a ride up to our local fabric shop where we buy our ribbon.

Based on my personal experience with Islam, the “emancipation” expressed by Houda and her school in the film – that of women working & learning, distinguishing between culture & religion – is nothing new at home. Even if we take Singapore out of the picture, Malaysia & Indonesia are both progressive Muslim democracies where women have Real Actual Rights. (Actually, women in general do have rights in the Muslim world, but it always makes a better story to paint us as poor oppressed beings in need of liberation.)

Anyway, all went well, checked for leeches a few times (hundred?) and none (phew...). No other wriggly things were lurking around and I actually finished the whole garden - mulched. I was absolutely drenched with sweat and hurting in places I didn't know I had muscles - shoveling, wheelbarrowing and spreading wet mulch is heavy work. After stopping for a rest, I decided to do a bit of weeding in the vegie garden and happily spent the rest of the afternoon potting around. Away from the mulch and the rocks, I had completely forgotton about checking for leeches...

This means that we've essentially had little to no power in half the apartment since then. It just so happens that the half that is without power is the kitchen and dining room, meaning we have no stove, fridge, microwave or my computer.

At the sweet old(er) age of 37, I have learned a lot of things about finding a career that works for you. When i was a kid growing up, there were not many avenues for those of us that fall under the category of “creative” without having it be within the conventions of any job with a degree. I took classes in high school that were aimed towards college prep. Nobody ever gave me the option of anything else. If i wanted a creative job outside of a college degree, i should go to beauty school. If i am a guy, i go to a trade school or start working in labor.

Its always the starters that I end up leaving for the last minute and invariably not make it at all. Ro keeps telling me its rude to hover around the kitchen when there are guests involved. I admit its rude to cook while they are around, but checking in on stuff in the oven, filling a tart or even frying something is acceptable, especially because these things, if made before hand, loses all the goodness. Which of course is all Greek and Latin to my husband and we end up arguing about it (always and in between all this commotion).
But, having said all of that, I now say this.
How the heck should I know?
Soooo...according to le Parisien, a grim mood prevails in Paris right now. There's been an unhostile takeover by sneaker sporting, map yielding, shopping bag toting, smiling faces & cameras, who are seemingly oblivious to the fact that the city is shut down as tight as a bordello on Sunday. There are expats like myself who are still smiling and happy to be here, no matter what the weather.
I haven’t had the pleasure myself. But my flock keep me informed of their goings ons, they seem to be somewhat troublesome, and even thirsty late in the night.

In terms of recent American politics there has been very little if any involvement by young attractive female celebrities that are able to add sex appeal to any cause they endorse. Just as these celebrities can add sex appeal to endorsing a product like beer or some fashion apparel, and actually cause the masses of people to buy the product, their endorsement of a political cause is so powerful that it can cause millions to buy an idea just as they would buy a product. When during the 2008 campaign Paris Hilton fired back at John McCain for comparing Obama to her, Obama proceeded to use Hilton’s main theme which labeled McCain as being old and out of touch. A few months after the Hilton commercials, McCain’s people were apologizing and begging for a retraction from Hilton, yet it was too late, Obama was already ahead in the polls and her attacks against McCain stuck, people came to see him as being old and out of touch and Obama as being young and representative of the new generation. Sex appeal was very clear in Hilton’s commercials as she did them in a 2 piece bikini. Than Paris Hilton proceeded to exit her political themes as they no longer served her brand, and instead jumped on the Angelina Jolie band wagon adding sex appeal to charitable causes which contribute to humanitarian efforts world-wide.
All I can figure right now, is that I want to push through the rest of this week so I don't have time to just sit around and think. Getting back to work will give me something to focus on. I'm tired of crying and I'm tired of being sad and worrying about other people and if what I have done to them is somehow detrimental to their emotional well-being. I am ready to keep moving forward.

“But the facts went further than that, and the flames of the ‘Lawful Rebellion’ sweeping through the land had been fanned by the disclosure through the Freedom Movement of the truth about people’s indisputable rights according to the Law of the Land, which formed the basis of the Magna Carta and the U.S. Constitution.”

GLITTER: Stickles by Ranger in “Icicle”
At first it seemed like Waze had some very notable issues, but then I realized I wasn’t really paying much attention to the app and missed some obvious features. After spending more time with Waze, I find it hard to find a complaint. If anything, it could be a bit more responsive. Its turn-by-turn directions weren’t always as quick or as clear as they could be, but they weren’t confusing. For example, Waze could mention the street name more often. Generally it just says “turn right” rather than “turn right on Awesome Avenue.” Personally, I’d prefer it was more descriptive more often, but that’s a small gripe that isn’t necessarily shared by everyone.

I'm sending this card to Operation Write Home (where the theme is "Miss You"), and I left it without a sentiment because I think it could be used by one of our terrific military guys or gals for any of several reasons; Missing You, Love You, Thinking of You, Wish We Were Together...

Marks little brother loaded us all into the back of his van and brought us all to the hospital. I stayed for one night and fractured my knee and two fingers. So I'm sorry if some of this is spelled atrociously... No one was seriously injured though. The worst anyone had was a broken arm and he was one of the guys who launched twenty feet. Thanks for reading and remember to never drink and sled or sled with inflatable pools. Both those things are bad.

Ever since Madonna made the “Blond Ambition” fashion statement of turning underwear into outerwear, modern celebrities and celebrity-watchers alike have cultivated a passionate love affair with the centuries-old art of body shaping. A few decades earlier, we let it “all hang out” both figuratively and literally. Gone were the girdles and bullet bras of the 50′s – the bra burnings of the late 1960′s were destined to influence the fashion tastes of a new generation of women.

Cars 2 takes place in a bigger, flashier and complex world than its predecessor but sadly, it is also louder, less emotional and more self-indulgent than the first film. When Cars came out in 2006, the novelty of an anthropomorphic world of automobiles somewhat evened out the chinks in the uneven script, now, this sequel seems so generic. Part of Cars 2 failure lies in the fact that it puts the sidekick (an annoying one at that) in the centre movie making its hero impotent. The first film was about the arrogant hotshot Lightning McQueen, the racing car, learning the error of his ways through his dimwitted but affable pal Mater, the tow truck. Unwisely, Ben Queen’s script puts Pancho before Quixote, alternately mocking him and wanting us to sympathize with him. And Mater, as it is clear from ‘Air Mater’, the bonus short that comes on the DVD, is endearing only in short doses and his bumbling shtick is often grating. But Cars 2 is by no means a bad film. It is just a sub-par effort which is hard to accept, especially as it is coming from Pixar, the animation giant that has trotted out 11 consecutive critical and commercial smashes. But some of the things work wonderfully. Like the Bond-inspired action set piece that begins the film, or the marvelous animation, be it the neon-lit streets of Tokyo or the idyllic scenery of Italy. The voice cast is equally good; Michael Caine is too good as the British spy car Finn McMissile and John Turturro as the racing car Francesco Bernoulli, McQueen’s pompous rival, is quite funny. And, the film moves at a breakneck speed that makes you ignore all its faults, at least when it is playing.
In "The Santa Suit," Sorbo plays greedy elitist and Hunter Toys CEO Drake Hunter who looks down on the whole of humanity until he is suddenly transformed from Fortune 500 phenom to Santa Claus to learn that when people are stripped of worldly splendor, and have nothing except their humanity to define them, they tend to make more heartfelt and purposeful choices.

On April 29, 2011, Tasca was on patrol when she got a call for medical assistance. Former Bogota Council Member Tara Sharp, concerned about the erratic behavior of her 22-year-old son Kyle, called the police to take him to the hospital for a psychological evaluation. Requesting police intervention, particularly in cases of this kind, is never a good idea. Sharp was exceptionally fortunate that Officer Tasca was the first to respond: She has years of experience as an EMT and had just completed specialized training

On the same day as the release of the Scottish data, Tesco reported their (much trialled) weaker figures and formally announced their fightback. The Tesco slowdown (which as I have been saying for a while, began for me according to the market share figures, in 2007) has accelerated a little and Philip Clarke has stepped in and put his reputation on the line. Profits in the UK were down (though even with the US, international was up) and the response seems to be reduced capital expenditure (perhaps recognising that large stores may have been overdone and the UK may be over-stored in that regard), more staff to provide better in-store service and the running of the stores “less hot” i.e. better merchandised and stocked.

Vanessa and Owen love every minute they get to spend playing with Aliyah. They also had a lot of fun playing with Uncle Solomon.

They sell daily fresh breakfast and brunch boxes. Take a look at some of their tantalizing offerings below:

The room that the surgery was performed in was quite cold. By the time I walked over to the table that you lay on, I was shivering. The nice assistants helped me climb onto the table, lay down and then offered me a blanket (thank heavens). Things proceeded quite quickly from there. They immediately started putting more numbing drops in my eyes. From this point on, I really unaware of what exactly was happening. The doctor and his assistants were very cheerful people. They talk you through everything without giving you too much detail. They even cheer you on and tell you what a great job you are doing. Your job is to lay still on that table and stay focused on the blinking light (orange in my case, but I've heard other say red). They also tell you to keep both eyes open which I found difficult to know if I was doing or not because one eye is being held open with lid holder/retainer type object and the other eye was covered with a dark object. It wasn't until I got home and watched the video of the procedure (yes, I did watch it and I wouldn't recommend it if you are squeamish and/or considering having it done until afterward) that I was able to put two and two together and make sense of everything that had taken place.
I didn’t much care for things Valley when I was there. Nothing was new, nothing was exotic. It was all hum-drum, boring. No one could ever write about the Valley (unbeknownst to me at the time, Americo Paredes and Rolando Hinojosa-Smith were doing it, and doing it very well), why would anyone want to? But I left for several years, and it was in that absence that I figured out I love conjunto music, I no longer see or hear a difference between us (Mexican Americans) and them (Mexican immigrants) when it comes to how we speak.

Investigators meeting or corresponding with the archivist and author discover he is an affable soul who enjoys discussing the history of his home county to great extent. He willingly puts off other pressing business to indulge in his penchant for pointing out landmarks, recounting legends, and dispensing what would be considered juicy gossip if the subjects of those rumors hadn’t been dead for over a century. Anyone who responds to his impromptu lectures with sincere interest will earn an invitation to dine with Philips at his home on a regular basis. Those who do so gain +1d6% to their Wildwyck Lore scores (see below) after 1d4 months of dining with Philips and examining the old diaries, artifacts, and maps he loves to share with visitors after meals (provided they wash their hands after eating).

6) If Jesus is Lord then Caesar is not.

Following on from the logic of my 5th point if Jesus is rightfully Mayor of London then Boris and Ken are not. We do not seek the good, peace and prosperity of our city through government officials we seek it through the practice and promotion of discipleship.
So she agrees to his terms and sets about making a web, while the male rests leisurely on a twig. When the web is finished, she lies down on her back in the middle of it, allowing the male to bind her legs.

Buddha statues, mosquitos and tuk tuks lead into an overnight train to Chiang Mai with a crazy train party with Sammy, the lady-boy, and nine others, that takes us into the small hours and instead of ending in Chiang Mai I join two new Canadian travel friends on a 4 hour bus to Pai for two nights of ‘chilling’ and trekking in the mountains.

Well as far as Hot Pockets go the Spicy Hawaiian Style Pizza is indeed one spicy number. I’m still feeling the burn from the residue in my teeth. Honestly, I’m not big fan of super spicy stuff (because I’m such a cool-cat, heh) but that doesn’t mean I didn’t like this – on the contrary it’s an excellent addition to the Pockets line up. In fact if I was a professional fire breather I would consider this the best food on the planet. So yeah, delicious, filling, and if you drink ‘Franks RedHot Sauce’ straight out of the bottle this Hot Pocket is for you. Even if you don’t try it anyway, just have a pitcher of water on stand by.
Nearly as dramatic are reforms in teacher tenure. To earn tenure, teachers will now have to rate in the top 10% (measured in part by student performance) for five of six consecutive years, and any teacher who falls into the bottom 10% loses tenure. No teacher in the bottom 10% can get a raise, while layoffs will no longer hit the junior-most teachers first while ignoring performance.

My mother and I have been talking since late summer about the whirlwind weeks of my parents' courtship. Four, to be precise. They'd started dating in the final month of my father's senior year of college at a Canadian university, after which he started medical school in the U.S., on a campus nine hundred miles away. My mother still had a semester to finish and hadn't planned on moving to another country.
Seriously though, there is a felt and immediate need in the Guyanese society for a serious operative, preferably at the ministerial level, to help the male population especially retrieve their identity and control of their families, fecundity and future. The PPP government has a moral responsibility to create the environment and channel the energies, skills and intellect of the men into productive work rather than having them as mere spectators as the country devolves into nothingness.
It was a fun thing to do on a Saturday morning :) and I am happy we did it. We ended up with so much color everywhere, it went right through our clothes and I ended up looking like an avatar creature! My arm pits are still blue, and I took three showers! My ears had dry powder coming out of them... and my hair was pink for awhile... all in all a very FUN run :) I kind of left wanting to dye my hair some funky color... hmmm? haha
Despite what Mariko and some journalists are saying, I doubt there are many ATT loyalists left in the parachute regiment or elsewhere in the armed forces. I suspect this evening’s conflict is not about ATT at all, but about who has the power to arrest whom and which soldiers will follow orders from the post-ATT leaders of Mali’s transitional government. No further word about the situation from Africable, and ORTM continues to broadcast its documentary. TM2 is showing “The Bodyguard,” with Kevin Costner and the late Whitney Houston.

This is the city in which I moved through several stages in my personal life with relationships beginning and ending, picking up my tears on the local park bench or letting my hair get brushed with a stroke of wind during a long embrace at the beach. This is the city in which I was once arrived as an illegal alien and I felt for the first time what it meant to fight for something that you truly want and become a legal resident to claim and hold my entitlement to be one with this town.
Egypt: Some 1,500 Muslims—several armed with swords and knives and shouting Islamic slogans—terrorized the Notre Dame Language School in Upper Egypt, in response to false claims from local mosques that the private school was building a church: “Two nuns were besieged in the school’s guesthouse for some eight hours by a murderous mob threatening to burn them alive;” one nun suffered a “major nervous breakdown requiring hospitalization… The entire property was ransacked and looted. The next day the Muslims returned and terrorized the children. Consequently, school attendance has dropped by at least one third.”
A number of folks I know tire of the kid-friendly policy there. Not me. While I find the uncontrolled playground atmosphere during the early dinner hours distracting, I also feel that it’s great that we have places where kids can see adults drinking responsibly. And I’m a sucker for a little one’s laugh. So, that’s not a problem for me.
Chakra is from Sansrit and it means wheel. I see them as energy protals in our bodies where power resides. There are 7 major chakras: the 7th is base of the (spine), the 6th is lower (abdomen) , the 5th is the (solar plexus), the 4th is (the heart), the 3rd is the (throat), the 2nd is the centre of the forehead (third eye), and the 1st is the crown of the head.

This would be the last year New York hosted the Oscars. And this would be the last hurrah for the New Century Theatre as well. It would be torn down in 1962 and replaced with the rather sleek, curvy 200 Central Park South co-op.
You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you reacted in those 5 seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what could have and should have happened.
Don't get me wrong, I've had my moments of being kind of ... (cough, cough), but I usually feel guilty about it and apologize afterwards.
Living in Singapore, I’ve come to rely on taxis. What my husband has shown me is how easy it is to talk to taxi drivers. It’s a common enough reaction of expats to generalize that Singaporeans love to know your business. They have no qualms asking how much rent you pay, what kind of car you drive, why you are in Singapore, etc.

"These include the devolution of consent over energy generating powers, a JobCentrePlus for Wales, the creation of a Welsh legal jurisdiction, and a bill to electrify the railways in Wales - all progressive proposals that would move Wales forward and ensure that our nation isn't left lagging behind the rest of the UK."
One moderately encouraging aspect of the report is the fact that the credit expectations indexes held onto the previous month’s gains, according to Wrightson ICAP. “The indexes for current and expected credit conditions held steady at their December levels, which matched the best readings in those measures since the collapse of Lehman. Small business owners still view credit availability as somewhat restricted, but conditions have eased again since the summer,” said Wrightson ICAP.
“At this point, it’s now going to be in the hands of the NTSB and the FAA, plus any Jamaican government authorities that may be involved, and to start and sort of backtrack and see what happened and how it can be prevented from happening again,” an AA spokesperson said.
The economy now is a fiction. The first five-year stretch of transition from August 1987 to August 1992 was the beginning of the destruction of the material world. We have progressed ten years deeper into the transition phase by now, and many of the so-called sources of financial stability are in fact hollow. The banks are weak. This is a delicate moment for them. They could crash globally if we don’t pay attention. If the banks crash …. then we will be forced to rely on the land and our skills. The monetary systems will be in chaos, and we must then rely on our direct relationship with the Earth for our food and shelter.
Along with two other co-plaintiffs, Jester King is challenging the TABC Code requirements regarding the content and wording contained on beer labels, such as the arbitrary "ale" or "malt liquor" legal designations and prohibited terms that may reflect alcoholic strength. Such unnecessary requirements have long been problematic for out-of-state breweries seeking label approval for their products to be sold in Texas.
Even though I was pretty lazy with February, (most of mine ended up being described to you) it was fun to see everyone else's photos and it gave me something to think about each day. So I figured I'd try again for March. Official rules and how to play at fat mum slim.

DOJ Says Requiring Warrant for Cell Phone Tracking Would ‘Cripple’ Law Enforcement – The Justice Department told a congressional committee that law enforcement and prosecutors would be crippled if they were required to obtain a search warrant for cell phone location tracking information. What happened to probable cause, the Fourth Amendment and a reasonable expectation of privacy?

I agree 250 kids nationwide is a significant number, but is it really "1000% more" than the number killed by sex offenders? That would mean sex offenders kill 25 kids or less per year. Maybe that's accurate, I don't know the data. I only pointed out that you're dramatically overstating the problem when you falsely bloviate that "drunk drivers kill enough people to fill a mid sized CITY 45,000-55,000 PEOPLE A YEAR."
A covey of doves resides on this barren tree. They come and go, vacating when blackbirds fly overhead, knowing better than to stick around where they might be attacked. They are almost the same size as the blackbirds, but they come and go in a mild way, resting between foraging trips down in the garden, and know precisely what to do when they see blackbirds advance toward them.
They are such a reasonable price ($12), too, that they would make a fantastic baby shower gift!

I think the colours and tones used here depend on the mood of the time in which the photograph was taken, as mentioned before, in relation to the happy and sad moments of their relationship. I think you can really feel the moods and get a good idea of what their relationship was like throughout. It’s like a look right into someone’s personal diary, which is why I think it works so well.
Well, they aren't holo and they aren't duochrome (ok, maybe a tiny bit) but they are glittery and quite stunning in my opinion. I think the let down of not being holo is what turned me off but I'm glad I caved in. I do love all things glitter you know.

Contrary to popular belief, the government back then was not laissez faire, although the market was freer than it is now. The industrial age was built on bribery, kickbacks, protective tariffs, government aid, land grants and yes, even legal monopoly status, all granted by the federal government. It was not a free market, Uncle Sam was not a disinterested third-party, and the captains of industry, thought hard-working and innovative, were not pristine free-market capitalists.

Here is this morning’s interview with Petula Clark.
After church, my parents headed to “Dunkin Donuts” to get some coffee. Heather and I went home. We changed clothes and I started to clean the porch from all the work that we did yesterday. After a little while, my dad and I headed over to pick up the kids from church and came home. We sat down and had a lunch having sandwiches, Middlesworth potato chips (my favorite!) and some drinks. After that, my parents left and headed home. I headed outside and did a little more work and then went into the basement and took a short nap. After my nap, I worked on this blog and catching up on some work that I had put aside for all the work I did for Friday and Thursday this past week. While I did that, I watched “Gene Simmons Family Jewels”, three episodes of “Dr. Phil”. I also started to put up some more of my miniatures from my “Lord of the Rings” Games Workshop line on Ebay. After that, I left the house to go pick up Ruth from Binghamton Youth Symphony Orchestra. I then got some gas and came home.
It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.
In several scenes, dreams filter into reality, as when Claude remembers a sexually charged encounter with a beautiful woman, and the woman appears, stretching her shapely leg up into the air, in a bath tub that's ludicrously placed in the middle of Claude's office. That woman appears again later in a scene that's presumably the source of Claude's erotic dream/vision, but the "real" scene has a similar absurdist visual sensibility, since the woman appears twice, reflected in mirrors on either side of Claude as though he were being asked to choose between two identical women. Indeed, he occasionally does seem to confuse his many women, as in a scene where the woman he's in bed with shifts between cuts from Catrine to several other women before settling back into his wife again; the bed and the room change as well, as Claude's mind mashes together different scenes with women from throughout his life, his erotic adventures all blending together. Other scenes are utterly inexplicable, ripped out of context as surreal intrusions of the subconscious: a man drowning while speaking on the phone, a short figure in a suit and a green reptilian mask who walks alongside Claude without saying a word.

This eve is my final photography class. So sad that it's nearly finished :-( I've loved every minute. I'll probably take the Photoshop course too, seeing I now have the fancy software and no idea how to use it. I love being able to keep learning new things. I want to be doing that for as long as I live. That's one of the main attractions of journalism for me, actually.
Oh so slowly. Slow enough to know I wasn't going to connect head on. Slow enough to know that I was certainly going to connect. I reached the bars to turn but not the brakes to slow. It was with pace and power that I shoulder-charged the van, pace and power enough to do insurance claim worthy damage to its side panel. With my shoulder. I bounced off. The bike flew away unscathed. I dropped to the tarmac and lay crumpled in the bright Sunday morning sun.
So why do our politicians sit and twiddle their thumbs? Why do they aid and abet by doing nothing? Can’t they see what’s happening to California? Texas? Arizona? The answer in a nutshell: No!
“Vertigo” opened up a new world to me – the world of Alfred Hitchcock. With a clever story, Hitchcock’s directing, and Bernard Herrmann’s haunting music, it captivated me. James Stewart turned my ideal “good guy” on his ear, presenting the image of a man flawed, obsessed, haunted by his past and trying to take control. The music in the film has stayed with me through the decades, down to last November when I first watched “The Artist,” and recognized the Scene d’Amour, used in the most climactic part of the film. That cemented my love for “The Artist,” as you can see in one of my earlier posts, A Lost Art.
Almost 142 million people live in Russia today (the peak was nearly 149 million in 1991, before the breakup of the Soviet Union took some land and people away from Russia). Most people have homes in urban areas of the European part of the country, or western Russia. This is where most jobs in factories and offices are found.

Remove the husks from the tomatillos, rinse them and slice them in half. Throw them on a sheet pan or cookie sheet with a rim, drizzle with a little olive oil, and place under the broiler for about 5 minutes, or until they soften, their bright green color turns pale, and some get some black spots. (Note: the original recipe says to roast them at 450 for 30 to 35 minutes... you should do it this way if your tomatillos are large, but the broiler method worked great for me because most of my tomatillos were apricot sized or smaller).

Giveaways are really fun to host. Quite weird if you think about it, since I'm the one having to provide the prizes and shipping costs and whatnot.

The closer Grace gets to Daniel, the more she jeopardizes her life, as her actions stir resentment in Jude and drive him to embrace the ancient evil Daniel unleashed that horrific night. Grace must discover the truth behind the boy’s dark secret…and the cure that can save the ones she loves. But she may have to lay down the ultimate sacrifice to do it–her soul.

Bonnie Langford's Mel has been much maligned and called the worst companion of all. Regardless of what you think of Mel (and I quite like her) she fits into this story perfectly, being nice, cute and fun.
Limit your em-dashes (—), which interrupt narrative sentences for a non-linear thoughts or, in dialogue, for actual interruptions to speech. Too many interruptions and you risk overextending the reader’s patience.
The story is called "Barbarian With a Gun" and it is awesome. Written by Chuck Dixon, one of my favorite comic book writers, and illustrated (pencils and inks) by John Buscema, it seemed a win-win without really even trying. But try and succeed it did. The story is typical Punisher, except that instead of the dirty streets of New York, the action takes place in fictitious sub-tropical island nation known as Puerto Dulce. Through the story Frank is put to the test. He is beaten, shot at, and otherwise abused. But through it all he perseveres in typically stoic Punisher fashion. The story also boasts some great dialogue with Microchip, Frank's nerdy computer-whiz sidekick, and a guest star from Marvel's comic The 'Nam, Iceman. The ending is a pretty cool piece of irony.

Occupy Wall Street is relaunching their movement today on this May Day 2012 and, honestly, I can identify with them in some respects but not all. I REJECT their Communism! But many of their complaints ARE valid and worthy of fighting for. The global bankers ARE fascists and they have a long history of financing fascism and Marxism all over the world. They are the elites and we are the serfs and if you don’t believe it just ask them and they’ll tell you just how much of a serf YOU really are. Fact is these fascists RED elites ARE the 1% and we who are the SERFS are the 99%! But we are far worse than mere serfs comrades. We are the OPPRESSED and the DEMORALIZED and some of us are so damned dumb we haven’t even figured it out yet!
It all started with a recommendation from a friend. I was suffering through an audiobook from an author whose first novel I’d devoured. But the second was unbearable, and because I have a nine-month-old and am unable to read for pleasure without cutting into much needed sleep, I was looking for something engaging that I could enjoy around the house/in the car.
Additionally, much of Jude/2Peter 2 is an allusion to Jewish writings just before the first century known as the “Pseudepigrapha.” These are Jewish writings (in Greek) that give a lot of “back-story” to many of the OT writings and give a window into Jewish belief and mysticism for some sects of the Jewish faith around the time of Christ.
My post yesterday introduced (to my knowledge) a new way of describing this generation of secondary school students: the "Control-F Generation." Sometimes they are called "Generation Why" but I think this is a total misnomer: they are willing to ask "Why do I have to..." or "Why should I..." but the deeper questions that the word Why should point to are often left unasked. Based on my limited observations - after all, I'm not a researcher nor do I have experience of secondary school students beyond my own experiences teaching here at U of D Jesuit - I do think there are certain traits that mark this generation in a remarkable way.
Yesterday David and I spent a few hours out and about enjoying the beautiful day after my hospital trip. It was pure joy to spend the day with my hunny bunny. (he rolls his eyes every time he hears that I call him that on my blog. tee hee!) Nothing spectacular happened - lunch out and a trip to our fave antique mall, but just spending the day with someone you love with all your heart & soul can bring joy in the most amazing ways. We finally had a chance to really talk about all that is going on in our lives. and as all of you know, communication is crucial in ANY relationship.
Add sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes and spices. Mix well and let cook about 3 minutes. There should be juices in the pan from the mushrooms and vegetables. If the pan is dry, add more oil or vegetable broth. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and nutritional yeast and let cook about 3 minutes.

Since then the Government, with some assistance from Europe, has attempted an “Operation Stable Door”. The Irish Commissioner has been salvaged. Solemn and “legally binding” assurances or declarations on some of the other problematic issues for Ireland have been promised by our partners. The Government can point to these as evidence that Europe has come to meet us to justify putting the issue to the people again. With the economy in freefall our need for friends in Europe, which constitutes our comfort blanket, has never been greater. Whether the voters will agree remains to be seen. There is a dangerous argument gaining currency that Europe will have to bend to our wishes, that the other 26 can do nothing without us. These are Interesting Times. I would not bet the family silver on that outcome!
You know, I never think about the reader per se. When I edit, I obviously aim for clarity for the reader’s sake but she is not in my head as I write. So how the story is perceived doesn’t come into my writing equation. I don’t workshop my fiction so usually the first inkling I get of whether something has worked or not is from an editor’s perspective. And I prefer it that way.
I've used this blog space largely to share our family adventures and my views on homeschooling and some random rants. I hope the information I've shared here has helped other families make their own great schooling decisions, plan their own great trips, enjoy a giggle or an outright guffaw.
But yet, saying that I put the final nail in the coffin today and put words to the (in my mind) unthinkable events of my childhood. Although I very much doubt I will ever have any clear memories but I have enough. Enough that I can no longer say "perhaps it never happened".. instead I now have to say "this is what happened".

Nineteen years ago I (Jerry) held my two-hour-old grand- daughter, Kendall, in the palm of my hand and silently offered a prayer of thanksgiving to God. I have never forgotten that day; its importance rivals that of my wedding day and the day my firstborn child came into the world. Arthur Kornhaber, researcher and writer, reminds us that there are three natural, life-transforming events in our lives over which we have no control: our birth, our death, and becoming grandparents. Even now, nineteen years later and with Kendall on her way to college, my heart skips a beat thinking about that moment when I held her in my hand.
I'm sure you can imagine. I'm reduced to a puddle of tears. It gives me a pit in my stomach.

On the 15th of every month, the Dueling Darlings have a little friendly duel here on our blogs. There's one theme chosen by the two hostesses who send kits to their team members.

If you have never read a book on marriage before, MacDonald’s Magnificent Marriage can get you on the right track. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with the book, but in comparison to what is available in marriage books, there’s little good about it either. Instead of MacDonald’s book, go and find a copy of one (or both) of the following two books: first, John Gottman’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, which is the most practically useful book on marriage I’ve ever read. The other book is Mike Mason’s The Mystery of Marriage, which is the most theologically stirring and poetic meditation on marriage I’ve read.
I ordered a cheeseburger off of the Billy's menu. I'm not sure it's quite as good as its reputation would suggest. It could have been a bit juicier, but I did enjoy it. The french fries that accompanied it were not so good. They were crispy, but had a dry texture. I like my fries to feel a little greasy.
The GGPs watched as police and dog escorted a bleeding, hand-cuffed man up from the stream road along the tractor path through their yard to the parking area of their house. There the EMTs secured him to a wheelchair, hoisted him into the ambulance, and whisked him off to a hospital for treatment. At this point the police departed, the ambulance departed, the fire-fighters went through some automotive gymnastics with flashlights to turn the truck around in our driveway, and then it also departed.

Carl F.H. Henry, a student of Clark’s and a domineering figure in American evangelicalism, remained critical of Barth’s ontology of scripture and the Word of God, while at the same time defending Barth against the more polemical attacks by other conservative evangelicals. Henry accepted Van Til’s reading of Kant and Barth’s appropriation of him, yet Henry was able to interpret Barth with greater nuance than Van Til. Henry saw Barth as an unfaithful Kantian, yet Barth instinctually rooted himself in the Reformed tradition, affirming that revelation gave humans objective, cognitive knowledge of God.
The Upfronts are less than a month away and yet many pilots have yet to screen for their respective nets. In fact, a number aren’t even completed yet. Lots of pre upfront buzz on what new shows are looking hot has begun and there’s a lot of conjecture, even among people in the know. Many sure things at this point last year considerably cooled by the time it counted and vice versa. There’s really no way to make an accurate prediction, unless you’re lucky to be in those scheduling room meetings. But, there are a fair amount of things that would appear to be safe bets, in terms of each nets respective needs and where they might make some moves. I freely admit I am just (educated) guessing here, but hopefully I am not way off base in my thought process.

Quite often I will lay my head at night and drift to sleep with a lecture, documentary or or audio book playing, in part to maximize my time on Earth, in part because it is the time of day when I am most receptive to knowledge absorption, and partly due to the instant dreams generated.
Our first stop was a bit of lunch. We stopped at a sushi restaurant right next to the Seattle Art Museum and after lunch we went to the art museum. We mainly went to see the Gauguin show that is closing soon. It was packed. I typically stay away from these mega art shows since it so difficult to actually see the art and everyone walks around like zombies with those little phone tour gadgets. The show was interesting regardless of the crowd. Gauguin seemed to be such an inconsistent artist. Some of his paintings are full of such lovely detail while others just really floundered. Actually, most of them floundered. That being said, the handful of paintings which I enjoyed were absolute perfection

Leif and I have wrestled with who to tell, if we should even tell anyone, what to say, how to say it...what will we do if it is...but it isn't...positive thoughts!!! This is just a taste of my internal conversation and sometimes external conversation with Leif. Up until I heard the word "Tumor", we kept everything to ourselves. I was afraid to be a drama queen, a hypochondriac, afraid to make a big deal of nothing, I didn't want to burden anyone or make anyone worry for no reason. I thought I could handle it...I thought WE could handle it but I spend most of my day in the company of a 2 year old who had no idea what's going on in my mind and I don't really get a lot of opportunity to pour my heart out to Leif and I am not sure I would if given the opportunity, as he is in the midst of a rigorous schedule and, again, I hate to burden him. He is the person that I go to for everything but right now is just such a bad time. He really needs to focus on work and I really need to just vent(something I rarely do on my blog)!

I'm really beginning to hate the whole romance element of the series. Rose was far enough for me. But then Martha, and now Donna too - falling in love with him. Maybe its naiive to expect that love could be kept out of this, but its making David Tennant's doctor look like a ladies' man, when traditionally, I suppose, he's always been a bit above that.

When I found it it was filled with bars of gifted soap too... seriously when I got to cleaning out my laudry room I probably would have thrown this to goodwill...that is if it weren't for trash to treasure tuesdays! I knew just what to do with it when I saw it... a little spray paint I had, a look through the box of drawer pulls and a glue dot and this is what I have:
The most interesting piece, the reason I was curious about the museum at all, was a coin said to be one of the 30 pieces of silver paid to Judas for betraying Jesus. They didn’t provide any back story except that the front was a Greek god and the back was galloping horses. How the coin came to be associated with Judas, I have no idea. I’d place the chance it had anything to do with Judas at just about zero. It was interesting to see and think about, even if it didn’t elicit any strong emotions for me.

They were seriously delicious. There is something about pork tenderloin that I love so much! I never even used pork tenderloin in my meals before I started cooking with my husband – but you can buy them pre-seasoned or plain and add your own. So easy! And it’s a pretty lean cut of meat, so you don’t add all the excess fat/calories.

Eyes more sallow than the golden they were more accustomed to being almost lit up as he misinterpreted. The mistake sent his mind along a path that had not occurred before. “A child of pieces and made greater than my sum? Yes that is a wonderful idea. A full plethora of possibilities! Yes, but one alone will not do. A spore alone is far too tossed on hazardous breeze. A thousand at the very least” he demanded as he became quite enamored with the thought.
In the course of my chaplain work I stopped by to visit a man who’s undergoing some severe testings in life. In respect to his privacy I won’t disclose the details, but the burdens he bears are common to all, but his is rather intense at the present time. He’s normally cheerful but during this visit he was weighed down by anxiety. I had little specific counsel to offer him as I carefully listened. In the end I shared a kind word with the goal of lifting his spirit. He’s been on my heart and in my prayers since then.

With a food processor or blender, puree the mango. Sieve it through a sieve and follow further instructions below to make your mango mousse.

But I digress... then there is still the shopping to be done for gifts. The returns (already) for exchanges. The cookies and treats to be made. The cards to be sent (!) how behind on those am I?? What else can I pile onto my list? Oh... I desperately need a hair cut. Like, I'm ready to put my hair in a pony tail and lop it off.
Then for the background, I grabbed my extra large circle punch from Fiskars, and made a mask. I placed the circle I punched where I wanted it, and used my repositionable Tombo tape to secure it. Then, I pulled out some of my $1.00 stamp pads from Studio G and﻿ some Stampin' Up Perfect Plum, as well as some Broken China Distress Ink, and more Tuxedo Black. I used sponge daubers and went from lightest to darkest to create my night sky. I did LOTS of coats of ink, because things dry very differently, as I'm sure you have found for yourself.

That doesn’t happen here. The “steady pace” headline is at odds with the image of destruction. The story mentions that a house was burned down by firefighters to clear the site for the new town hall, but that’s pretty far to ask the reader to go to reconcile this unfortunate juxtaposition.
A WIDOW’S HOPE is the first book in The Miller Family Series. I had read the other books in this series but had missed this one, so I got this book so I could read the beginning book. Hannah is very well developed, as are the other characters. Simon and Seth both seem to be main point of view characters as well. I couldn’t understand why Simon disliked Hannah so very much, but Hannah didn’t exactly jump when he said jump.

Providers follow guidelines. Medical doctors have guidelines on how many and how often to give pills. People respond differently and dosages have to be adjusted. I set plans following research as a guideline for how often and how long to see a patient but modify for individual need. In my office my average new patient face time is 25 min, and for patients established in a treatment plan I average about 12 min. I see a patient about 12 times for an single complaint. Some less and some more. A patient’s time in the office does not always correlate to the amount of face time with me. A visit may be from 10-60 min depending on what other therapies are prescribed for their treatment. The important thing to me is that patients feel like our goals were achieved in their time in my office.
Not surprisingly, I approached it exactly like an academic paper. We were asked to blog about TV episodes, and I took it very literally. I actually took notes during the episode to keep track of characters and every plot twist. I wrote about three drafts before I was satisfied, but still had no idea if it was anything remotely close to a blog (of which I had read about 3). But it was not as difficult as I expected it to be, and I realized that I could relax my writing and do without the 3 revisions (which was good, because after the first week, I didn’t have time for that anyway!).

During breakfast, I started noticing the smell of something burning. It was the leaves. They burn the fallen leaves in Foshan (in China?). I have no idea why. The smoke was pretty bad. I had to teach one class of kindergarteners in a different classroom on the other side of the school so that we could breath more easily.

I am a big fan of Marvel, even though I never read a single comics. I love each Avengers and even their enemies, but I must admit I adore Tony Stark/Iron Man. Like my brother pointed out, his character is selfish yet appealing. He’s an asset for the film (thanks to Robert Downey Jr. as well). Supporting characters were not left behind either. Hawkeye and Black Widow haven’t had their own franchise but they were well introduced and interesting (I’d like to learn more about them).
Both Luck and Griffin could be future Pro-Bowlers. Both could be busts. One could succeed and one could fail. It could be anywhere in between. No matter which option it is, it’s not going to be because of anything that any pundit says (including me), and no one knows for sure how or why either will succeed or fail until it actually happens. Until we reach that point, both are excellent choices and you could flip a coin to pick either and be confident that a good pick was made.

Mmm, no planning application yet but once Tesco get their teeth into something like this it's very difficult to stop, especially as the council will be saving millions.

Ok, so it's not the tipycal apple strudel, it has vanilla wafer cookies inside (delicious), it was made with puff pastry and I think it was better than the one with phyllo pastry.

Non plussed by the negative blowback, Rosen doubled down:
I live in California and it is illegal in this state to sell home-baked goods (even non-perishable ones!) to the public. I currently make cookies for friends and family until I can figure out a commercial kitchen that won't cost me more to bake out of than I make on the cookies. I'm not gonna lie, decorated sugar cookies take a long time (from baking, to waiting for the flood icing to set, to decorating) and I haven't figured out how to make a profit while renting a kitchen by the hour.
Every time I tell someone about this, they either say "Wow!" or cry (well, that's the grandmas mostly). But honestly, I am relieved and optimistic, because we have a plan that I am comfortable with and a doctor I feel comfortable with. We just happen to have to travel to Boston for it. I actually wish they would call tomorrow and say they have a cancellation this Friday and want us to hop on a plane. I just want to get this going so it will be over faster.

Despite hours of hard labor during my 10 months in AmeriCorps, I don’t think I ever dropped below 200 lbs. The problem was the food. Our galley on campus had unlimited fried foods, breads, processed junk. Every meal ended with an ice cream sundae. I often felt sick after I ate, but never had the mental strength to change the way I was eating. At one point, while working in Alabama, my team decided we were going to eat healthy in the conventional wisdom way- lots of veggies (good), tons of whole grains (bad), lean meats (not the best), and several small meals throughout the day (not great). I felt constantly hungry and unsatisfied the entire time. All I wanted to do was eat and eat and eat everything in site. I didn’t have access to a scale at the time, so I don’t know if I lost any weight. My guess would be no since my clothes never seemed to fit any differently. My entire team was also afflicted with the worst gas ever. Our van smelled terrible and outsiders tried to stay as far away from us as possible. Not great.

Data also gives you ammunition to advocate for a child, whether it can be with parents, a medical professional, or another educator. It can give the student a way to build confidence and motivate extra effort, too. The biggest thing data offers, though, is feedback about what worked and what didn't. Of course, every teacher needs to look at what didn't work so they can improve or reteach, but I think for new teachers, the other is just as important.

If you are not a serious student of the Word, please consider doing so. Please consider reading the entire Bible from beginning to end and to seek help in understanding the way that both the Old and New Testaments fit together. Thru the Bible with J. Vernon McGee is an excellent option. His works are available in print and online in both written and in audio form. I have purposely avoided using outside commentaries and other writings as I want to stay within direct Biblical quotes.
Once a child reaches adolescence, though, the parents are no longer the primary influence. Number one becomes peers, and number two becomes the media (and in saying the media, that means movies, television, music, internet, etc.) There is no “this is right and that is wrong,” there is simply, “if I do this will my peers think it’s cool,” or, “if I don’t do that, will my peers mock me.”

As far as the District Council is concerned obviously we are waiting to find out if there is any change in the balance of power or at least the semblance of some opposition! We are waiting to see who will be sitting on the Planning Committee. We will then try again to persuade them of their obligations to involve the local community in consultation and discussions in matters that affect residents lives. We will challenge this false assertion that Planning Committee members are not allowed to talk to residents and listen to their arguements. This is made quite clear under the National Planning Framework Policy which states:

My little crank radio that has been using the same set of rechargable batteries, actually on the same charge from last spring, if I remember correctly is very power efficient. The radio does have a hand crank, but that is a lot of cranking every 5 min or so, or 1 set of batteries, per every 2 years. It can also bring in the weather networks.
Example B. One of my hobbies is dog training, handling, showing, and judging. Along the way, I'm often approached for advice by dog owners who do not set specific rules and boundaries for their furry loved ones. Dogs have very different social structures than humans. Giving dogs free reign and no rules usually leads to dogs who misbehave in a variety of ways including: jumping on people, gnawing on people, ignoring people, running away, refusing to obey commands, growling at people, challenging or fighting with other dogs, getting food whenever the dog wants, or food aggression. When people ask me for help with these issues, I immediately point them to the Nothing in Life is Free program and the Umbilical Training Method. These programs and other variations are quick and easy methods to teach dogs rules and reinforce desirable or undesirable behaviors. Simply, the dog must offer desirable behaviors prior to receiving food or attention. It is the owners who should demand and get the attention, and not the other way around. Many dog owners assume that dogs should behave in the fashion that we desire, but they are dogs and do things that dogs enjoy.
Consider the 1961 statement of US President John F. Kennedy (JFK) before media personnel:
Sometimes these disagreements are an opportunity to improve things in unexpected ways. Going back to Shadows on the Moon, after the initial edit letter, it was clear from my editor's comments that she and I perceived a particular character in very different ways. She pushed me to make changes to his behaviour to make him more vivid and understandable to the reader. But I felt that this would change him so profoundly that he wouldn't be the same character and the story wouldn't work anymore. We debated it over the course of several emails and through a couple of edits. Being forced to defend who this character was against my editor's extremely perceptive and insightful comments made him come into such clear focus for me that although I didn't make the changes my editor wanted, I did make several other changes - and my editor loved them.

Here in Siem Reap, as usual we’ve had most of our meals at the Hawaii Restaurant on Wat Bo Road, where the food is good, the service always friendly, and the kids can play pool. As usual, they beat me every game. My friend So Pengthai, a tour guide, has been busy with clients most of the week, but we met for dinner one night. He brought along his 2-year-old daughter. His wife has to stay home and take care of their newest arrival: a son that was born two weeks ago! Speaking of new events, my friend Rong, who works at the Siem Reap Airport, also met us for dinner one night and brought something new of his own: the young woman he married three weeks ago! And to top off the list of things going on, So Pengthai is headed to Phnom Penh next week to apply for a visa at the US Embassy. His tour company wants to send him to a training course in Cleveland (Cleveland?! Yes, that’s the plan!) in late April. Needless to say, he’s quite excited, but also a bit reluctant to leave his wife and newborn son for the six weeks that the course will take.

Looks like the Artic weather is on its way, the snow flakes are beginning to float by my window. (16:15 Sunday 1st Feb). The forecast for next week is snow and ice brrrr. I'm just glad that the car I've got now has a decent heater so the journey to work (which will presumably take longer because of the snow) should at least be comfortable.
(Before I go any further, I want to tell any of my current players reading this that I'm not making an attack on them, because they have all made an effort to keep track of stuff. But I'm worrying about any "newbs" that might join the game in the future, as I'm running an "open" game at a FLGS and I want to encourage new players to join.)
I really wanted to start stitching on some of my cards, but me and the sewing machine don't get on - I did have another go with it a couple of days ago, but I couldn't even thread the blimmin' thing lol. So I decided to have a go at hand-stitching on today's card, and I'm quite pleased with it really :o) Maybe one day I'll work the sewing machine out, but at least I can do it this way until then!
As you’ll see, it’s considered funny by the House generally (even she laughs to go along with it, though obviously Harriet Harpieperson wouldn’t have).
I have to disclaim that the last of the unexpected beery events was actually expected. On the way home, we stopped for dinner at the legendary pub, the Man of Kent Tavern, in Hoosick Falls, just inside the New York border. This place rates, in my mind, as one of the beeriest places in all of human civilization. The Tavern is eclectic to say the least. There's a fare amount of English pub fox-hounds-near-short-tailed-horses-ness, but there's also a crazy array of soccer jerseys, militaria, golf flags, beer paraphernalia—and anything else that could be held from a nail—dangling from the ceiling, like clothes drying in the breeze. It's almost amazing at the amount of things to look at. The Man of Kent exudes beer, it is nearly the perfect personification of what drinking beer is about. It's fun, it works at its own pace, its a little off center and it has amazing beer. The Man of Kent let me top off my day—a day spent with my wonderful wife—and nothing could have capped the day better that a crock of French onion soup, a grilled turkey and cheese sandwich and a pint of Fuller's London Pride—with a pint of Greene King's Abbot Ale for dessert.

Since our first lesson with Heather last month, we've been trying to work on exercises to increase Granite's hind quarter strength. Heather told me to try to ride him from his butt (channel my lower level dressage days). She also has us trotting, one walk stride, trotting to try to help him not dive into his downward transitions. We've been working laterally into corners when we ride the diagonal to change direction. She also pointed out my weakness in my left hand that is causing weakness throughout my horse's left side (major fail on my part). So, I've been doing extra reps at the gym on my left arm and consciously exaggerating my left hand to keep it UP when I'm riding. I've also been working disproportionately to the left during my rides to help Granite gain the strength that I've screwed him out of.
